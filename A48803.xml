            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have here preferred to your obſervance and protection, a work of great Art, and of greater Induſtry; you ſhall find in it a Summary of almoſt all the Kingdomes and Common-wealths upon the earth, and what were the men of Power, which commanded in them, and alſo what were as well their Excellencies of Underſtanding as of Soveraignty; it being a Gift unto great men, who are called unto extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary places, to be indued for the
<pb facs="tcp:107135:3"/>
moſt part with extraordinary abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>Here, as from a Turret of Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, you may look down upon the Vulgar, and every where behold how near of kin is Miſery to Mortality; and raiſing afterwards your Contemplation higher, you may looke up on thoſe who have been the Potentates and Princes of the Earth, and obſerve how empty is the Title of Greatneſſe, and how vain in the Grave is the Prerogative of Kings; inſomuch that if the Duſts of Alexander the Great, and of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus his Horſe, were committed both unto one Urn, I do believe that Ariſtotle himſelf could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt them, either by his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or his Flattery.</p>
            <p>Sir, It it is then eaſie to be ſeen that it
<pb facs="tcp:107135:3"/>
is onely Virtue that crowneth the lives of Princes, and after their deaths doth raiſe them higher then their Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids; yet in many Examples you may diſtinctly here obſerve, that even the beſt of Kings, and thoſe of them who have been neareſt unto Heaven, have often ſtooped under the greateſt Viſitations, as the higheſt Hills are moſt often checked by the lowdeſt Thunders.</p>
            <p>But others there have been, whoſe lives by their Luſt and Cruelty, have been covered with infamy, or by their Sloth, with ſilence; as Tertullian ſpeaks of Sardanapalus, that if he had not been famous for his Riot, no man had known him to be a King; therefore thoſe depraved Affections are here deſcribed, and by many Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly illuſtrated, in the purſuit
<pb facs="tcp:107135:4"/>
of which ſo many great men and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours upon Earth have both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and periſhed.</p>
            <p>They are produced as a Caution unto all, and the Book may ſerve as a Mirrour unto the Beſt, in which they may obſerve the uncertainty of humane condition in the Pilgrimage of this life: It preciſely (Sir) devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelf to your protection in whoſe Example, as in a purer Mirror may be read all the Influences of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and of Chivalry; which that you may long live to diſpence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, is the dayly prayer of him who is,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That all Princes are but Pilgrims, and ſome Pilgrims are higher then Kings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His at firſt may ſeem a paradox; but upon a deliberate conſideration it will eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle it ſelf: For if you look upon a King (in the firſt place) as he is but a man, he is a Pilgrim, and no more. He begins his journey in his cradle, and travels every year from ſorrow unto ſorrow. The pleaſures and pomp that courts him are but momentary, like a flaſh of lightning, that is rather the ſubject of his memory then his eye: But the troubles and the dangers are perpetual, and lie as heavy upon his heart as the Crown upon his head. This was not unaptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by the Tyrant, who (his friend affecting the crown) did invite him to a Banquet, where there was nothing wanting either for abundance, or magnificence; the Sea and Earth were examined for their rareſt proviſione to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107135:5"/>
his palate, and on the Cupboard <hi>India</hi> did appear in all her treaſures; This indéed did promiſe a welcome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the invitation; but behold, over his head a ſword hung upon one hair, and by its ponderous burthen carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain Death in its point, did threaten a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to him, ſo that the edge of his appetite being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and the Banquet ended, there needed no man to ſay ſo much as, <hi>Much good d'it you,</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this, I know not by what ſecret tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ambition it comes about, that the Crown is the onely object of all great Spirits, not conſidering what cares hang round about the ring ols of it. This was that which made the great Turkiſh Emperour, ſeeing a ſhepheard ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a hill, and making melody to himſelf, as he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his puiſſant Army againſt <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> O happy ſhepheard (ſaid he) who hath neither any remarkable Town, nor any Army to loſe.</p>
               <p>Agreable to this, is what at leaſt the Poets enform us of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>England,</hi> who lying on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſending for the Crown, his Son came to viſit him, and beholding the Crown on the pillow, and his Father ſo faſt aſléep that not the leaſt motion of breath could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to come from him to vex the lighteſt feather on the pillow, he took the Crown away, conceiving his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be dead. Not long after his Father did awake, and miſſing the Crown, demanded where it was, and who was ſo bold as to take it away? It being anſwered, That his Son had it, to whom it was due by the right of ſucceſſion, his Son came in, to whom his Father ſaid, That if he knew with what travel both of mind and body, and with what danger of both it was purchaſed, he would never be ſo haſtie to take it away, but kéep far from it, as from the center of all ſorrow and affliction.</p>
               <p>And if the whole life of man is but a Pilgrimage, the life of Kings is the greateſt pilgrimage of al, A pilgrimage it is both of the mind and of the body, to which they are moſt ſubject, who have the moſt and the greateſt Kingdoms.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107135:5"/>
Their life is a perpetual vexation, whether you look upon them as greedy to poſſeſſe the Kingdomes of others, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to defend their own. No ſooner one trouble is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but another begins, occaſioned either by covetouſneſſe or ambition, or by jealouſies extrinſick or Domeſtick; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they fear the over-growing power of their neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Princes; ſomtimes they do lie in wait to intrap them; ſometimes they fear the conſpiracies of their own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; ſometimes of their own children; for you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that in this nature, the condition of Princes is of all moſt miſerable. How many Kings may I number up who have been all deprived of their lives by the unnatural conſpiracy of their own children! <hi>Juſtin</hi> makes mention of an Emperour of Perſia, who by divers Concubines had fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſons, who all held in a conſpiracy with the eldeſt to take away the fathers life, for no other cauſe but that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he lived a little too long, and they were reſolved to depend no longer upon expectation.</p>
               <p>And it appears to me a great wonder that the ſpirits of men ſhould be ſo much blinded and that Princes ſhould be ſo misguided by the Prince of the ayr, that although they are aſſured within themſelves, and may be convinced by a thouſand examples, that a revenge not to be avoided, doth attend ſuch deſperate contrivers, yet no age almoſt hath béen without a Preſident of ſuch horrible Parricides. <hi>Irenus</hi> King of the Moloſſi, having conſpired with ſome of the Nobility, who were moſt near unto his father, did not long after by poiſon take away his fathers life, and being himſelf inveſted with the Crown, although he injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time a happy and quiet life, yet he was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his conſcience within him, and having loſt the love of his ſubjects, he at laſt loſt his own life, his people having made war againſt him, and being taken by them he was beheaded in the ſame place, in which he conſpired his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtories can afford us a thouſand examples of the ſame nature, but <hi>Herodotus</hi> makes mention of <hi>Enanthus</hi> a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107135:6"/>
Prince, as unblemiſhed in his converſation as innocence it ſelf; who paſſing through a world of afflictions which like waves came rowling upon him, one on the neck of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was firſt baniſhed, and afterwards put to death by his ſubjects, and dying, confeſſed that it was the firſt hour of his happineſſe, being to paſſe from a Labyrinth of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and perplexity into an everlaſting Elizium of Peace and Reſt.</p>
               <p>But to give you an inſtance what miſerable Pilgrims Princes are, you may behold <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> who from the height of glory was by divine vengeance metamorphoſed into a beaſt, and wandring from field to field in a worſe condition then a Pilgrim, he fed on the graſſe of the field for ſeven years together, and was wet with the dew of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and at the laſt returning to himſelf, he acknowledged the divine power, and the divine Iuſtice, which taught him to underſtand in what a frail condition he ſtood and how uncertain is life, and the glory of mortality like the Lilly in the field, which appears in the morning in all its beauty, and more richly apparelled then <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory, and before the evening it is gathered and fades away, &amp; is ſeen no more.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Juſt ſo are Kings, the flouriſhing array</l>
                  <l>Of the proud Summers meadow, which to day</l>
                  <l>Weares his green pluſh, and is to morrow Hay.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Philip</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with himſelf what a pilgrimage this life is, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the life of a King, which as it is more full of ſtate then the life of others, ſo it is alſo more full of danger, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Page every morning to come unto him, and to pronounce a loud, O <hi>Philip</hi> remember that thou art mortal, which though his ſon ſeemed to forget, and therefore would be eſtéemed immortal, and have divine honours done unto him, yet whoſoever ſhall take the pains to behold him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the height of all his victories, he ſhall find that his

life was the greateſt pilgrimage, nay I may ſay the arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſlavery that was in the world: for what did he do, but became onely a ſlave to his own ambition to inſlave the world and to make it ſtoop to his yoak. A plundring Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim he was, and under the pretence of glory and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he enjoyed no reſt either by day or by night, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled from place to place, uncertain in the morning in what field to take up his lodgings the night following, or where he ſhould dine the next day, but as if he would try providence, as well as victory, he did put all things to the adventure; and indeed it was providence that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, for into how many dangers did he raſhly run, from which he was miraculouſly preſerved, and by a rare happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, made his raſhneſſe alwaies to be the increaſe of his glory. I ſhall on this ſubject ſpeak ſomething of him, which <hi>Curtius</hi> never thought on, which is, that when he took a poor Pyrat priſoner; he asked him, how he durſt be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent as to commit ſuch robberies on the ſeas. The Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat nothing diſmaied, made anſwer, he did it with the ſame confidence as <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, who went up and down plundering and deſtroying the world. And when Fate had put a period to his life and Empire, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable how this invincible ſpirit became heavy and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, which on purpoſe in this place I do inſert, becauſe many who have delivered his atchievements to memory have left it out and it may more plainly appear what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary things great Princes are, when that power doth forſake them which doth lead them to their high underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. <hi>Alexander</hi> being come to Babylon, he put off his cloaths one evening to anoint himſelf, to make his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more nimble in ſome exerciſes in the field with his companions, in which hee much delighted. The ſport beeing ended, as hee returned to put on his cloaths, the young Nobles who were with him beheld a man who ſate in the Kings ſeat, and had put on his royall habiliments, and the Diadem on his head. They amazed at it, demanded who he was; the man would make no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107135:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at all, at laſt being threatned that he ſhould indure the greateſt torments if he would not confeſſe what he was, he at laſt ſpake in Greek, that he was a poor fellow, who being unjuſtly condemned to death, was delivered from it by the God <hi>Seraphis,</hi> who ſeated him in that place, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to put on the royal habiliments. The wonder increaſing that there being ſo many of the guard and of the Kings aſſociates, in the field and in and about the Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and not any of them ſhould either diſcover the man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming into the Pavillion, or putting on the cloaths. <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo poſſeſſed with horrour at the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſpectacle, that he became as a dead man, and for the thrée days following was ſo mute and ſtpid, that he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as another creature, he would neither ſpeak to any, nor return any anſwer being ſpoken unto, till he went unto the houſe of <hi>Theſſalus Medius,</hi> where he drank the fatal poiſon, and being carried afterwards to his own chamber, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with himſelf the condition of man, and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely of Princes, who in the height of all their luſtre, like the ſun at noon, were ſuddenly eclipſed by ungrateful clouds; howſoever it is worth your obſervance, that even in his death deſiring to traduce the world with a falſe belief of his immortality, he deſired <hi>Roxane</hi> who was preſent with him, and at that time great with child by him, that ſhe would give way that ſome who were moſt faithfull to her, and to himſelf, might take his body (he finding an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of recovery, and death apparently to grew upon him) and throw it into the River of Euphrates, that the army and the world might conceive, that inviſibly he was advanced from mortality, and tranſlated into the number of the Gods, which when <hi>Roxane</hi> by no means would give way unto, affirming that the power which protected him from ſo many dangers, would preſerve him ſtill, he was paſſionate againſt her, that in pretence of love ſhe ſhould deny him immortality and dying in the flower of his youth, he acknowledged how momentary and uncertain at the beſt is the condition of Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107135:7"/>And thus <hi>Alexander</hi> you ſee, who contended to be above the reach of mortality, and to be no Pilgrim, became the greateſt Pilgrim in the world; for he not onely living was in a perpetual travel both of body and of mind but he did not reſt being dead, for his body was carryed from place to place, until it was brought at laſt to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and afterwards conveyed unto <hi>Memphis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to ſpeak the truth, the condition of Kings is more lamentable then the meaneſt of their ſubjects, who may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their lives with ſafety, which is permitted but to a few Kings, ſo true is that of <hi>Juvenal.</hi>

               <p>For this reaſon the Honourable Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> who ſaid.

madneſs, to protect him from the violence of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; You may behold him expoſed to all the dangers that malice could imagine, reviled by his own wife, curſed by his own ſervants, and conſpired againſt by his own ſon, and driven out of his City by him, ſo that he might well ſay, I am a ſtranger in the land, and my life is waxen old with heavineſs, and my years with mourning.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt before I proceed to give you examples of it, I ſhall exhibit to you, that the pleaſures and the ſplendours which commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Court, and do caſt ſuch a falſe ſhew of Glory on it, are but as ſo many flatterers, who would perſwade to things which are not &amp; onely leave a dazle on the eye, the eaſier to delude and betray the underaſtnding. It is vertue only that maketh Princes glorious. I will firſt give you a general ſurvey of the vertues and vices of Princes, by which in the pilgrimage of this life, ſome have attained to the heighth of honour, and others have ſunk into the loweſt infamy. And firſt, to deface the vice of Avarice, I will in this place ſhew you the vertue of Liberality; to put the churliſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous out of countenance, I will extol the liberal, which in taking is ſhamefaced, in giving joyfull: For a meaſure in taking and in giving, is the true nature of liberality; Neither can he that taketh all things though he give much, be named liberal in nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of the Lacedemonians, ſo obſerved the laws and rules of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that he was wont to ſay unto the Citizens of <hi>Sparta,</hi> that gifts are more dangerous ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to be received, then hurtfull to be refuſed. Which <hi>Phocion,</hi> the whole glory of <hi>Athens,</hi> at what time <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had ſent him great gifts, wealthy preſents, jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and treaſures from <hi>Perſia,</hi> did ſhew a true example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107135:8"/>
of in refuſing the ſame, ſaying I will not learn to take, leſt I forget to give. The like anſwered <hi>Zenocrates</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher to the ſelf ſame <hi>Alexander,</hi> when that he did ſend great ſums of gold and ſilver for love and affection unto <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrares,</hi> he ſaid he wanted neither gold nor ſilver: Which when it was told unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> he ſaid; Hath <hi>Zenocrates</hi> no friends then that want money? <hi>Alexander</hi> hath more friends then either the ſubſtance of <hi>Darius,</hi> or the wealth of <hi>Perſia</hi> can ſuffice: A Queſtion is here to be demanded, Whether of them both was more liberal, the Prince in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or the Philoſopher in refuſing? When certain Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Samnites came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and being at <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius</hi> houſe, they perceiving the liberality of <hi>Fabritius</hi> to be ſuch, as it were pity wealth ſhould want to ſo noble a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, at their return from <hi>Rome</hi> unto their Countrey, not forgetting the free dealing of <hi>Fabritius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe Embaſſadours minding to gratifie <hi>Fabritius</hi> with the gold of the Samnites, ſent gifts and preſents to him unto <hi>Rome,</hi> for their noble entertainment; which were refuſed with an anſwer, that <hi>Fabritius</hi> had rather rule and govern them that were ruled by gold, then to be ſubject unto gold; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the anſwer of <hi>M. Curius</hi> to the Embaſſadors of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> offering large gifts and treaſure after the like ſort, That to poſſeſs much is no wealth, but covetouſneſs; to deſire nothing, and to give is perfect wealth and liberality: A ſound proof of two liberal Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>When ſuch ruled <hi>Rome,</hi> then the Romans excelled all the world, bountifull and free and moſt beneficial unto all, and covetous unto none When <hi>L.

When <hi>Pomponius Atucus</hi> did ſend unto <hi>Cicero</hi> being baniſhed, two hundred thouſand Seſterces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Volumnius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> as much, then <hi>Rome</hi> was benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al When the Senators reſtored <hi>Faucula</hi> and <hi>Oppia,</hi> two poor women of <hi>Campania,</hi> not onely unto their ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but doubled their wealth and riches, for their true

meaning and ſervice to the Romanes, the one praying and ſacrificing for their good ſucceſs, the other toyling and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling about the ſouldiers buſineſs at the ſiege of <hi>Capua,</hi> where <hi>Fulinus</hi> was Captain, then <hi>Rome</hi> was mercifull. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality in noble perſons is moſt commended, for in liberal giving; and beneficial doings, are Princes compared unto Gods. <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> having certain of his ſouldiers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the wars of <hi>Carthage,</hi> did ſend unto the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> for money to redeem the Roman ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> according unto Martial law, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied of his ſuit, he commanded his ſon ſtraight to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſell all the lands and livings that he then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt about the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to bring him money. The money being brought, he paid <hi>Hannibal,</hi> redéemed his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers brought them frée to <hi>Rome</hi> upon his own charge, and being blamed of the Senators that he ſould his land, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he had rather want patrimony in his Country, then love towards his Countreymen; he had rather be without living in <hi>Rome,</hi> then to want the good will of tho poor ſouldiers. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the great King of <hi>Arragon</hi> was wont to rejoyce more in one little ſentence that <hi>Titus Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patianus</hi> would often ſay, then of all that he had read all the days of his life: This Emperours golden ſentence was, That day to be unhappy in the which he neither gave or granted any thing to ſome man, ſaying, That no man ought to depart from a Prince ſad. Ho judged time loſt, when no body fared the better by him, and thought no man ſhould depart without ſome benefits done, or gifts given to ſome, or others Liberality doth purchaſe to the Prince, faith and love; to the Nobleman, ſervice and homage; unto all men, benefits and good turns. Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, not ſo deſirous to take, as willing to give, was wont to ſay to any that demanded where his treaſures, wealth and ſubſtance that he got in the wars were kept, by poynting with his ſinger to his friends, it is hidden, ſaith he, in the hearts of my ſubjects. What can be more commended in a ſubject towards his Prince, then faith and truth? What
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107135:9"/>
may be more praiſed in a Prince towards his ſubjects then liberality and lenity? The liberality of the poor is good will. A poor Scholler ſometime of Gréece, being in Rome, thought good to ſalute <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Emperour comming from the Capitol toward his pallace in a few Gréek verſes, thinking thereby his penury ſhould be ſomewhat looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Caeſar:</hi> But <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> anſwered the Scholler in writing again the like Gréek verſes, which when it was delivered to the poor Gréek, he delighted much in the reading, commended highly the verſes, and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> where he was in his Chariot, opened his purſe, and gave unto the Emperour four ſingle halfpence, ſaying, Hold, not according to thy dignity &amp; calling, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ability and poverty I give this reward. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the poor Scholler was more commended for his ſmall gift to the Emperour then the Emperour himſelf was prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for his liberality unto all the people in Rome. The poor Poet <hi>Antilochus</hi> was as liberal to his power for his verſes made unto King <hi>Liſauder,</hi> as <hi>Liſander</hi> was in his calling to give him his hat full of ſilver. Simple <hi>Sinae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> had no better preſent for a proof of his liberality toward <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, then to ſhew his good will unto him in writing, whereby he ſhewed himſelf more willing then able, which being accepted, he was liberally rewarded, for every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral verſe a piece of gold. What greater gift can any man give, then that which proceedeth from the heart? Of all treaſure, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the mind of a man ought moſt to be eſteemed; the Mite of the poor woman offered to Chriſt was no leſs made of, and eſtéemed then the Gold, Myrrhe, and Frankincenſe of the great Sages of the world. For the gift maketh not the giver liberal, but the giver maketh the gift liberal. Wherefore a poor Student of Paris going
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107135:10"/>
home to his country <hi>Scillia,</hi> and being urged through penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wanting money, to go to a great learned mans houſe (as though he might go to ſome of the Biſhops of England) tarrying there a long while without either meat or drink, perceiving the houſe to be gorgeous, fair and brave with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> As though he might ſay, fair buildings want more liberal dwellings, then liberal Lords fair houſes, for the houſe is praiſed by the man, and not the man by the houſe.</p>
               <p>Fair houſes and wealth do hardly make men liberal; it is ſaid that fair things are coupled with pride, and wealth joined with covetouſneſſe. In the beginning, all men were liberal, untill private wealth began to practiſe with money, covetouſneſſe was not known for as money did increaſe, fo covetouſneſſe grew. In <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny</hi> money was not ſeen four hundred years and more, after the building of Rome. Then was Rome true and beneficial bp reaſon of liberality, which after waxed wealthy and falſe, by means of covetouſneſſe. That City was moſt famous chiefly for her liberality, wherein Rome excelled all the world; if the death of Princes, of Noble men, yea, of all men can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently bear witneſſe of their lives, conſidering vertue and fame ſhall prove that by death, which life hardly may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (for no man is well known during life.) The death of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> that moſt renowned Prince of Thebes, and Conquerour of all Gréece, was a ſure and a certain ſhew of his liberal life. The laſt day of <hi>P. Aemilius,</hi> who trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in life time over the proud Macedonians and Liguri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, was a true token of his frank and frée dealing in life.

                  </gap> the Samnites, the other triumpher over Carthage and Numantia, whoſe renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives, made their deaths famous: whoſe worthy deaths, do revive their noble lives. Their beneficial dealing and liberality, was well known by their deaths: ſo liberally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107135:10"/>
they lived, that their friends found no money hidden, no gold kept, no treaſure preſerved, no wealth at all, though divers time by victory and triumphs, by conqueſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they psſſeſſed Kingdomes and countries in the time of life. The greateſt Prince in his time <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the firſt King that brought the Monarchy unto Perſia, ſlain by <hi>Tomyris,</hi> had on his grave being buried in Scithia, in no gorgeous Temple, nor ſumptuous Tomb, but in an open field, this Epitaph <hi>Here heth <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great King of Perſia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented now with ſeven foot, who could not be ſatisfied ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with ſeven Kingdomes: what <hi>Caeſar,</hi> King, or Prince ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, ſpare this place unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                  </hi> And when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, paſſing with his army unto Scithia and India, had read this Epitaph, and perceiving the ſlippery eſtate of Princes, the uncertainty of life, and mutability of fortune, he much doubted the ſtate of his own life: howbeit, at that voyage he forgot by means of <hi>Mars,</hi> the Epitagh of King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> untill he returned from India, from his wars into Babylon, where he married <hi>Statira</hi> King <hi>Darius</hi> daughter, whom before he conquered: where ſuch liberality was ſhewed, ſuch magnificency done, ſuch gifts given ſuch ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets kept that <hi>Alexander</hi> upon his own charges married the moſt part of the Nobles of Macedonia, unto the Ladies of Perſia, the feaſts during five days amounted to the ſum of thrée and twenty thouſand Talents, every Talent valued at fourſcore pounds, he repeating oft the Epitaph of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> would ſuffer none, though divers Princes were preſent, to be at any charges but himſelf, onely ſaying that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune giveth unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> the ſame will <hi>Alexander</hi> give unto his friends, for <hi>Cyrus</hi> grave is appointed unto <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> in this <hi>Alexander</hi> paſſed all Princes, in taking all, and giving all: private faults may not deprave open ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, every man hath a fault. <hi>Alexander</hi> was known to be a drunkard; <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was noted to be ambitious; <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the the great King of <hi>Syria</hi> blamed for lechery. <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> of pride; <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107135:11"/>
for one vice may not be forgotten for their divers vertues: Vertue muſt not be hidden for that vice is manifeſt. <hi>Phrine</hi> a Courtiſan ſometime of Gréece, though for her ſlanderous life, worthy reprehenſion, yet for her liberality ſhe ought well to be remembred, for after <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had ſubdued that famous City of Thebes, and made the walls thereof even with the ground: ſhe offered to re-edifie the ſame upon this condition, that upon every gate of the City this ſentence ſhall be ſet. <hi>This City <hi>Alexander</hi> the great threw down, and this City <hi>Phrine</hi> the Courtiſan builded up again.</hi> The like I have read of Queen <hi>Rhodope,</hi> ſometime a Courtiſan, and a lewd woman, who made up the brave and ſumptuous work, called the <hi>Pyramides</hi> in Egypt, where ſhe uſed ſuch liberalliry, ſuch a vaſt expence of money, that for her nobleneſſe ſhe was well worthy to be commended, though for vitious living ſhe was otherwiſe to be blamed. Men and women were deſirous then to be liberal: Then Princes were as liberal and beneficial with ſuch lenity and humanity unto the poor, as they grew afterward to be hard and covetous with ſeverity and cruelneſſe. Therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxilaus</hi> a liberal Prince, was often wont to ſay, that the chiefeſt commendations and nobleſt vertues which could be in a Prince, were, not to be overcome in beneficial do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Attalus</hi> King of Aſſa, languiſhing in ſickneſſe, and ready to dy, bequeathed his Kingdome and Scepter of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, unto the noble Romans by teſtament, fully and freely to beſtow it on whom they would, for that they were ſo liberal and beneficial ſometime towards him, whileſt yet fortune favoured him not.</p>
               <p>A liberal Prince cannot be void of love. <hi>Antigonus</hi> was wont to anſwer <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> one of his Councel, who was brought up of a boy in his Kitchin, when he ſpake any thing againſt princely gifts, and found fault with <hi>Antigonus</hi> libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, that his talk did ſmel of the Kitchin: A fit repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion for ſuch a ſaucie ſervant, who hindred Kings from doing good, and moved Princes to do evil. I would ſuch Sycophants ſhould be ſo anſwered by Princes, as <hi>Ariſtode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107135:11"/>
was of King <hi>Antigonus.</hi> Worthy of perpetual memory was <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for his paſſing liberality towards the poor ſouldiers that came from the Lacedemonian war with him, he made them that came on foot unto him, to go home on horſeback; he that came on horſeback, he ſent him home in a chariot; and he that had a village before he came unto him, he gave him a city at his going away from him. A Prince worthy of Subjects, and a Captain moſt fit for Souldiers. What made <hi>Julius Caeſaa</hi> to be beloved of his ſouldiers? What cauſed <hi>Alexander</hi> to be honoured of all men? Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and liberality; The one in the great Wars at Pharſalia, at what time he conquered <hi>Pompeius</hi> the Great, having all the treaſures and ſubſtance of <hi>Pompeius</hi> brought before him, took nothing from the ſouldiers but <hi>Pompeius</hi> letters: The other, after he had vanquiſhed King <hi>Darius,</hi> having a great cheſt full of treaſure, where he found in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent coyn, two hundred thouſand pound, beſide other ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable treaſures and jewels took nothing from his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers but a little book named the <hi>Illiads of Homer,</hi> wherein he delighted more to read the noble acts of the Gréeks, and the worthy feats of the Troyans, then in all the wealth of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. Thus liberality maintained their fame; Thus their magnificent benefits ſo ſpread forth their noble names, that happy was he that could be a ſouldier unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</hi> I remember a certain King in Syracuſa, named <hi>Hiero,</hi> who underſtanding the liberality of the Romanes, and perceiving the penury of victuals which then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſuſtained in the wars of Tharſimenos, did ſend three hundred thouſand buſhels of wheat, and two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of barley, with great ſums of gold and ſilver to eaſe the Roman ſouldiers,, and fearing that his gifts would not be taken, nor his preſents received, conſidering the nature and liberallity of the Romans, he willed the Embaſſadours to ſay that it was an homage and ſervice of good will, ſent to honour the Romans from <hi>Hiero</hi> King of Siracuſa an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent policy to practiſe beneficence, with manifeſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a liberal heart. O Rome how happy haſt thou been,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107135:12"/>
through thy liberrlity and good will haſt won the hearts of all Kingdomes and countries, Vntill <hi>Ninus</hi> time all things were common, no diviſion of ground no hoording of mony, no covetouſneſſe known no greedineſſe of Kingdomes, no deſire of wealth: in fine, for the ſpace of two hundred and fifty years, for the ſimplicity, innocency and true dealing of people, it was worthily called the golden world, and then a man could not find a covetous perſon, and now a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find a liberal friend; then no man knew to do evil, and now no man knoweth to do good; then no man did take, and now no man doth give: in fine, then one for another and now all for themſelves. What made <hi>Cimon</hi> a liberal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Athens, to be ſo famous in Greece? his liberality amongſt nigards he onely counted liberal, and all Athens beſides covetous, whereby he deſerved renown and glory, amongſt ſo many nippers of money, he onely ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bountifull and liberall. What cauſed <hi>Flaminius</hi> to be ſo much ſpoken of amongſt the Romans? his liberal gifts amongſt ſo many greedy takers, his open benefits, amongſt their privat wealth and hidden hatred? What moved the Agrigentines to honour ſo much the manly <hi>Gillias,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his fame to extol his name? his liberality. Such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe then was in Athens, Rome, and Agrigentum, that then worthy were theſe of admiration and praiſe, who avoided the cankered ſtate of avarice. Thus from the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den world, it came unto the ſilver world, and then to that hard mettal the iron world for the covetous people can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied. The young Partridge, by nature is ready to flee as ſoon as ſhe commeth out of the ſhell, the wild duck to ſwim, the Lion to go, and man onely born ready to ſeeke and travel for money.

All the Kings that ever reigned in Rome, almoſt from baſe birth and ſlender progeny, were advanced by fortune to ſit in the royal throne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Princely Scepters. <hi>Romulus</hi> the firſt King and builder of Rome, born of <hi>Rhea,</hi> a Veſtal Virgin, and daughter unto <hi>Amulius,</hi> was left as a prey unto beaſts, forſaken of all in Rome, ſo hated of his own grandfather, that he found more friendſhip in a ſhe Wolf, then he had at his grandfather <hi>Amulius,</hi> more kindneſſe of the Wolf for his nouriſhment then love of his mother, though he was born of her. Notwithſtanding, contrary to the expectation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulius,</hi> being not thought of in Rome, he was by a Woolf preſerved, and by a poor Shepheard brought up to be a King of Rome. The like hapned unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> at thrée days old, when he was commanded by his grandfather King <hi>Aſtiages</hi> to be drowned, and delivered unto <hi>Harpagus</hi> chief officer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

                  <hi>Aſtiages,</hi> by King <hi>Aſtiages</hi> own hand, to be killed and deſtroyed: yet by fortune, a Bitch (he being left as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> was) fed him and gave him milk and life when his Parents appointed death for him, and being thus brought up by a Bitch, he was the firſt and moſt renowned King that ever reigned in Perſia. Even ſo may I alledge of <hi>Paris</hi> King <hi>Priamus</hi> ſon called likewiſe <hi>Alexander,</hi> who being commanded to be killed as ſoon as he was born, he was brought up by a Bear to be a famous Phrigian Prince. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> by fortune, found more friendſhip in a bitch then in his own mother: <hi>Romulus</hi> more love in a Woolf then in all Rome: <hi>Alexander</hi> more kindneſſe in a Bear then in his father <hi>Priamus.</hi> What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Pelephus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who was foſtred by a Hart or of <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Semiramis,</hi> the one brought up by a Mare, the other by birds of the air to be ſuch famous Quéens, as the one ruled the Volſcians the other the Babylonians; How for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune appointed little Ants to féed King <hi>Midas,</hi> and Bees to féed <hi>Plato,</hi> the wealth of the one, and eloquence of the other did certifie the ſame: but I will declare firſt the extolling and advancement of ſimple and baſe men unto Princely ſeats. <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus,</hi> a ſtranger born in Corinth, the ſon of <hi>Demaiat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus fortune to ſhew her might, exalteth the poor, and oppreſſeth the proud. Thus from baniſhed ſtrangers, from ſimple ſhepheards, moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Princes, and noble Kings have proceeded. Fortune as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, from low birth, and baſe conditions, hath

made Princes; many have béen advanced from the Plough to ſit in ſeat of Kings, as <hi>Gordius,</hi> who from the plough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a King in Phrygia: Fortune took <hi>Agathocles</hi> from his fathers ſhop being a Potter, and made him King in Sycilia: ſhe brought <hi>Darius</hi> from the Stable of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be a King in Perſia: ſhe brought <hi>Giges</hi> from a Shepheard to be the wealthieſt King that ever reigned in Lydia: <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus</hi> a ſwine-heard from féeding his Swine, became the mighty Emperour of Conſtantinople. And Carpenters likewiſe may brag of <hi>Telephanes,</hi> whom fortune adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kingdome of Lydia. Shall not Husbandmen extol fortune, which made <hi>Valentianus</hi> Emperour in Rome? How much did fortune favour learning, how brought ſhe the greateſt Princes in the world to honour ſimple men, and cauſed the cruelleſt tyrant to eſteem and reverence the ſame? King <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> that wicked tyrant of Sicilia, when he heard that divine and noble Phyloſopher <hi>Plato</hi> was coming unto Sycilia he made certain of his Nobles to go méet him on the ſea, and in a ſhip bravely appointed, and gorgeouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed with Sails of purple ſilk to bring him to land, where <hi>Dioniſius</hi> himſelf did attend his coming in his golden Chariot, with four white horſes trapped over with gold, and having taken him into his own Princely Chariot, he talked unto him reverently, uſed him honourably, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> had deſcended from the skie, greater honour could he not get in Creet, then <hi>Plato</hi> a poor Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtons</hi> ſon of Athens obtained in Sicil. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> born in Stagira a poor Phiſitians ſon named <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> merited ſuch fame that not onely <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, thanked God that his ſon <hi>Alexander</hi> was born in his time, under whoſe tuition <hi>Alexander</hi> five years lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Philoſophy, but alſo <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, Conquerour of the world honoured and ſaluted him as his Maſter, unto whom he ſaid that he was no leſſe bound for his learning and vertuous education, then he was unto King <hi>Philip</hi> his father for his birth, he declared the ſame being in India, a country far from Greece, &amp; in the midſt of his great wars,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107135:14"/>
he did write unto him of the ſtate of India, of the ſucceſſe of his journies, and the prodigious and monſtrous ſights that he ſaw in his expedition.

                  <hi>Bion</hi> being demanded what was the moſt dangerous thing in the world, he anſwered, to be moſt fortunate. <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> that learned Athenian, was wont to ſay, that better it were to lie careleſſe upon the ground, ſafe and ſound, then to lie with trouble of mind under cloth of States in danger and peril. A certain wiſe Prince, before he was crowned King, did take the Crown firſt (as <hi>Valerius</hi> ſaith) in his hand, and after looking and muſing a while upon it, he ſaid, O Crown, more noble then happy, whoſe peril to enjoy if men underſtood, no man would take thée from the ground, though thou didſt offer thy ſelf unto him What felicity happened unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, whom fortune ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be a King of Kings, a Conqueror of Conquerors, yea to be worſhipped as a God, and to be called the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe fame compaſſed the whole earth, in ſo much, that <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> Quéen of the Amazons came from Scythia unto Hyrcania with thrée hundred women to lie with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> thirty days to have a child by him; and yet in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon that fortune that ſo exalted him, did likewiſe oppreſſe him, being in his chief fame, and but thirty two years old, poyſoned by his kinſmen and friends, and ſo left and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all men, that he was thirty days unburied, as a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, not as a King, and rather like a beaſt then the ſon of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> In the ſame manner fortune ſerved <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who after the glory of ſo many conqueſts, was in his own city of Rome, and in the Senate houſe amidſt his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, treacherouſly ſlain and murthered with Bodkins and Daggers, by his moſt truſty friends <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> that he had twenty and thrée wounds in his body. This was the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107135:14"/>
unfortunate end of ſo fortunate a beginning. How did fortune deal with famous <hi>Xerxes,</hi> whoſe huge armies dryed up rivers, whoſe infinite numbers of Navies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Ocean ſeas, whoſe power and force all Gréece trembled at; fortune that promiſed all Gréece to him, did give him over into the hands of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his enemy to be vanquiſhed, and unto the force of <hi>Artabanus</hi> to be ſlain. A little better ſhe uſed <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of Pontus, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many victories in divers countries, and noble triumphs againſt the invincible Romans, ſhe at length to his great diſcomfort, after he had loſt his wife, children, and all his friends, did leave him in his old age a prey unto <hi>Pompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius.</hi> Therefore was <hi>Plato</hi> wont to thank God, that he was born a man, and not a beaſt; in Gréece, and not in Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and thanked fortune, that he was a ſcholler unto <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who always deſpiſed fortune and her power: For for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune never doth a good déed, but ſhe requiteth the ſame with an evil turn afterwards. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> that valiant King of Epy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, whom fortune guided ſo famouſly, that he was counted by <hi>Hannibal</hi> the ſecond ſouldier and Prince for his magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity and courage, unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, was killed by a ſilly ſimple Argive woman with a Tile ſtone. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> whoſe name was ſo terrible unto Rome by the ſpace of ſixtéen years, was driven into exile, and became a baniſhed abject from his Countrey, and weary of his life, he ended his days with poyſon in Bithinia. <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> whom fortune ſo favoured that he excelled all men in perſonage and birth, in wisdome and honour, in ſtrength and wealth, and in all kind of vertues, was brought to ſuch baniſhment and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to ſuch infamy and reproach, that he was compaſſed round, and taken by his enemies, and burned in his bed with his whore whoſe name was <hi>Timandra. Cambyſes</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> whoſe cruel and unhappy days both Rome and Perſia long time felt; their fate was ſuch, that after much tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bloodſhed, being weary in murthering of others, they ſlew themſelves: This was the end of their cruelty.</p>

ſo that he was named fortunate <hi>Polycrates,</hi> at length (being ſo ſerved of fortune as other Princes were) he was taken and hanged by one <hi>Orontes,</hi> an Officer of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> in the open ſight of Samos, where he a long time flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and in the end was hanged on a high hill named the mount of <hi>Mycale.</hi> Theſe evils happen by fortune, yet we ſée them not; ſhe gripes us with her hands, and yet we féel it not; ſhe treadeth us down, and yet we will not know it. Happy is he that accompanieth not with fortune, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers think themſelves happy that he fortunate: As <hi>Gyges</hi> and <hi>Croeſus,</hi> two Kings of Lydia ſo wealthy that they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no man ſo happy as they were; and yet was <hi>Aglaus</hi> the pooreſt in all Arcadia, and <hi>Byton</hi> the ſimpleſt of all Gréece (the one by the ſentence of <hi>Solon,</hi> the other by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi>) judged far more happy then they. The very ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> being baniſhed from his Kingdome of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, would often ſay in his miſery That happy twice were they that never knew fortune, whoſe fawning face in the beginning doth purchaſe cruel death in the end. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certain Lacedemonian called <hi>Diagoras,</hi> being in the Games of Olympia in Gréece having his children, and his childrens children crowned with Garlands of Fame, for their vertuous acts and qualities, ſaid, that it were great happineſs for him to die preſently at ſuch a ſight of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Fortune; and being asked the cauſe, he ſaid, That Fortune never pleaſed that man ſo much at one time, but ſhe would at another time diſpleaſe the ſame as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And moſt true it was ſpoken unto one of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tyrants, who being in banquet with divers Nobles and Gentlemen, when the houſe fell and ſlew them all; yet he eſcaping, bragged much of his fortune that he ſo ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a ſimple man hearing it, ſaid to him, Never boaſt of Fortune at any time, for that ſhe ſpareth thee now, ſhe will the next time more ſharply plague thee. Which came ſo to paſs; For his fleſh was made a food to his horſes, and his bloud was the drink which was appointed for them.</p>
               <p>If Fortune, whoſe wavering ſteps are never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107135:15"/>
were as little truſted of the moſt as ſhe is moſt deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and falſe to all then <hi>Cicero</hi> would not have ſpoken, that they which ſéek Fortune are blinder then Fortune; ſhe never advanced any to dignity, but ſhe ſuppreſſed the ſame again unto miſery, as <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the proud, a King that Fortune made famous divers waies, of Princely Progeny of paſſing perſonage of incredible beauty and of all noble qualities; but <hi>Lucretia, Collatinus</hi> wife, was made the onely ſnare to catch him, and to take him, by whom he was deprived of his government, and baniſhed out of Rome, to range countries in miſery and pain after long felicity and pleaſure: even ſo <hi>Dioniſius</hi> King of Siracuſa, after many Princely pleaſures, renowned fame, great glory, yet in the end was baniſhed his country, and driven to keep ſchool in Italy. In the like ſort, that noble and valiant <hi>Scipio Affricanus</hi> was deceived, whoſe proweſſe and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity augmented much the fame of the Romans by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of Affrick and Carthage, and notwithſtanding, he was driven to exilement and miſery, where he died after many triumphs and victories like a poor beggar. O uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtate and ſlippery wheel of Fortune.</p>
               <p>And becauſe fame followeth fortune, and proceedeth from Fortune, as the ſmoke cometh from the fire (for as Fortune is variable, ſo is Fame divers) if we ſeek Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we find the fame of poor men for their poverty is great, as well as the fame of the rich, for all their riches: poor <hi>Codrus</hi> and ragged <hi>Irus,</hi> are as famous in reſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beggars, as <hi>Midas</hi> and <hi>Craeſus</hi> two wealthy Kings of Lydia.

it doth flow of rich men for their wealth, of Giants for their bigneſs, and of ſtout men for their courage: What is it but a pilgrimage in which we live &amp; travel here?

What greater Fame could <hi>Cyneas</hi> have for all his memory, when he was ſent from King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> as Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to Rome, where the ſecond day, in the Senate houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people of Rome, he named all the Senators by name? What greater renown could King <hi>Cyrus</hi> have for his noble memory, for naming every ſouldier of his by name, being in the Camp? What Fame hath King <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> for his divers and ſundry languages, which he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Interpretor, could ſpeak unto two and twenty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being his ſouldiers, but onely that they are recorded in books, where likewiſe <hi>Calviſius, Meſſala,</hi> and ſuch oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men that forgot their own names are committed into Hiſtory. Doth not <hi>Homer,</hi> the Trumpetter of Fame, write of <hi>Militides</hi> an Idiot, who after the deſtruction of Troy, and the death of King <hi>Priamus</hi> and all his ſons, would come to ſuccour the Troyans? <hi>Homer</hi> (I ſay) doth not forget <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides,</hi> no more then he doth <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> What ſhould I ſpeak of ſilly and wicked <hi>Heroſtratus,</hi> who for burning the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> is everlaſtingly remembred: And mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions more of the like nature, who are mentioned by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers?

                  <p> Of magnanimity of Princes, and their fortitude of mind, where and when it was eſteemed.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Iuſtice without temperance is often counted injury, ſo magnanimity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect unto prudence is but tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. This vertue proceedeth from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and a ſober mind, joyning both the body and the mind together, ſo that the wiſedome and policy of the one, the ſtrength and courage of the other, are united and alwaies ready to defend the cauſe of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the quarrel of their Prince, and ſociety of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: unto this therefore every good man is born, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring common commodities before private wealth <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> pondering much, what he might beſt do, and to what he ſhould apply his noble mind, there appeared unto him two goodly women, the one, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> doth deſcribe, very gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and brave, rings of gold on her finger, a chain of gold about her neck, her hairs compoſed and friſled, with pearls and Diamonds hanging at her ears: the other in ſober and comely apparel, of modeſt behaviour, of ſhame faced countenance: they ſtood both before him. The firſt ſaid, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> if thou wilt ſerve me, thou ſhalt have gold and ſilver e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough thou ſhalt féed daintily, thou ſhalt live princely, thou ſhalt injoy pleaſures: In fine, thou ſhalt have all things at thy will to live with eaſe and reſt. The other ſaid with comely countenance, If thou wilt ſerve me <hi>Hercules,</hi> thou ſhalt be a Conquerour of conquerours, thou ſhalt ſubdue Kingdomes, and overthrow Kings: thou ſhalt be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into fame, renowned in all the world, and ſhall deſerve praiſe both of men and women. Which when <hi>Hercules</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood taking into conſideration the idle ſervice of the firſt, and the exerciſe of the ſecond, he took her as his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and willingly became a ſervant to her. Wherefore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107135:17"/>
according unto promiſe made, he injoyed fully the fame and praiſe by due deſerts; he overcame Lions Dragons, Bears, and ſuch monſtrous huge wild beaſts, he did deſtroy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and countries; he had that fortitude of mind, that he conquered Giants, and ſubdued Tyrants inlarged liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſet frée Captives and priſoners: and briefly that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity was in him, that he never effended juſt men, nor hurt innocent men, he preſerved divers Kings and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, he never ſpoiled good countrey, nor ſubdued a juſt King, but wholly addicted himſelf to merit fame. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Serpent <hi>Hydra,</hi> the Dragon the Lion, the wild Bore and terrible Bull, conquering <hi>Geron, Cerberus,</hi> and <hi>Diomedes,</hi> cruel Tyrants. He took the gilded Hart, he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Centaures, and the ravening birds named <hi>Stim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalides,</hi> was there any tyranny in theſe his enterprizes? but <hi>Hercules</hi> they ſay, was more aided of the Gods, then helped of man. With theſe his princely acts and renowned feats, noble <hi>Theſeus</hi> was much enamored, inſomuch that he emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the vertuous life of <hi>Hercules,</hi> he tamed wild beaſts, ſlue monſters, overcame cruel <hi>Creon</hi> the Tyrant of Thebes, he deſcended alſo as the Poet ſaith unto hell, to imitate the feats of <hi>Hercules,</hi> to reſemble his magnanimity, to augment <hi>Hercules</hi> fame, erecting alters, appointing ſacrifice in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Hercules,</hi> hoping that others would do unto <hi>Theſeus</hi> as <hi>Theſeus</hi> did unto <hi>Hercules.</hi> Next unto <hi>Theſeus</hi> for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of time, that valiant and renowned Gréek <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſucceeded, who was the onely ſtay and comfort of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the very hope of Greece, his magnanimity, valiant cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, worthy acts, and famous life is at large ſet forth in <hi>Homers Illiads,</hi> which <hi>Homer, Alexander</hi> the great ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the reading of the atchievements of <hi>Achilles,</hi> being brought up in ſchool, in his fathers days, with that learned Phyloſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that he never went to bed but he had <hi>Homer</hi> under his pillow, and there fell in love with the proweſſe of <hi>Achilles,</hi> honoured his life, and magnified his death inſomuch that he went unto <hi>Illion</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where that famous City of Troy ſometimes ſtood, to ſée the grave
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107135:17"/>
of <hi>Achilles,</hi> where, when he ſaw the worthy monuments of his martial chivalry, his famous feats and renowned life depainted about the Temple, which invironed round his ſumptuous Tomb, he brake out into tears, beholding the tomb, and ſaid. O happy <hi>Achilles</hi> who had ſuch a Poet as <hi>Homer,</hi> that ſo well could advance thy fame. And thus <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> being moved by <hi>Homer</hi> to imitate <hi>Achilles,</hi> minded nothing elſe but magnanimity and courage of mind, as <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> can well teſtifie, whoſe life though it was but ſhort, was a mirrour unto all the world, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but twenty years when he began to imitate the acts and feats of <hi>Achilles,</hi> in twelve years more, (which was his whole time of life) he became King over Kings, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over Conquerours, and was named another <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> for his proſperous ſucceſſe in his enterpriſes, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the firſt and moſt valiant Emperor that ever was in Rome, after his great conqueſts entring into the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> in Gades, and reading the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> painted round about the Temple, his worthy fame declared, his noble déeds ſet forth, his victories and conqueſts in every place deſcribed, ſuch monuments and mirrours in memory of his noble life every where expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he fell into the like tears for <hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> did for <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was one in love with another for magnanimities ſake, each one ſo deſirous of others fame, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought himſelf happy if he might be counted <hi>Alexander, Alexander</hi> judged himſelf renowned if he might be named <hi>Achilles, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> ſought no greater fame then <hi>Theſeus, Theſeus</hi> ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the name of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Therefore <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of the Lacedemonians wondered much at the ſingular magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and proweſſe of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> ſometime Prince of Thebes, who with one little City could ſubdue all Gréece. This <hi>Epaminondas</hi> having wars with the Lacedemonians, people no leſſe renowned by war then juſtly feared by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> after great victories and triumphs; was after this ſort prevented by <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> in the wars of <hi>Mantinia,</hi> that all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107135:18"/>
the people of Sparta were counſelled either to kill <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi> or to be killed by <hi>Epaminondas</hi> whereby the whole force and power of Lacedemonia was fully bent by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment given by <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> their King, to fall upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paminondas,</hi> where that valiant and noble Prince by too much pollicy was wounded to death, to the utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the people of Thebes; and yet being carried unto his tent alive, he demanded of his ſouldiers the ſtate of the field, whether Thebes or Sparta was conquered, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified that the Lacedemonians fled and that he had the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, he forthwith charged the end of the ſpear to be taken out of his wounded ſide, ſaying, Now your Prince <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> beginneth to live, for that he dies a Conqueror. We read not of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his parralel, who being compared unto <hi>Agamemnon</hi> for his magnanimity, was angry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſaying <hi>Agamemnon</hi> with al Greece with him, was ten years about one town, the City of Troy <hi>Epaminondas</hi> with little Thebes in one year conquered all Gréece. An order was obſerved amongſt the Lacedemonians before they did go to the wars, they were by their Laws charged to make ſolemn ſacrifice unto the Muſes; And being demanded why they ſo did, ſith <hi>Mars</hi> hath no ſociety with the Muſes; <hi>Euda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midas</hi> then their King, anſwered For that we might obtain as well of the Muſes how to uſe victory gently, as <hi>Mars</hi> to become victors manfully.</p>
               <p>Theſe Lacedemonians were ſo valiant, that having ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their King <hi>Cleonimus</hi> for his extraordinary pride and violence did make <hi>Arcus</hi> King in his place: Who being in Creet, aiding the people of Corcyra in wars with the moſt part of the Citizens of Sparta, <hi>Cleonimus</hi> their exiled King conſulted with <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of Epyre, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him then or never to conquer Sparta, conſidering <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in Creet, and that Sparta was not populous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any ſtrength of invaſion; they both came, and pitched their field in the open face of the City of Sparta, aſſuring themſelves to ſup that evening at <hi>Cleonimus</hi> houſe. The Citizens perceiving the great Army of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> thought

               <p>No marvel it is that the children of theſe women ſhould be valiant &amp; high in their reſolution.

Hardie then the Romans were, when <hi>Scaenola</hi> went alone armed unto the Tents of <hi>Porſenna</hi> King of Hetruria either to kill <hi>Porſenna</hi> or to be killed by <hi>Porſenna,</hi> greater fortitude of mind could be in no man: a more valiant heart alſo was ſéen in no man then in <hi>Cocles,</hi> who alone reſiſted the whole army of King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> and when the draw bridge was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, he leaped in all his harneſſe from his enemies into

the midſt of the river Tybur. And though he was in divers places ſore wounded yet neither did his fall hurt him, nor his Armour preſs him, neither the water drown him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thouſands of his enemies could kill him, but he ſwam through the river Tybur unto Rome, to the great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> and excéeding joy of Rome; ſo that one poor Romane gave the repulſe to the whole Army of a King. Valiant was Rome, and the Romans feared, when <hi>Popilius</hi> was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, King of Syria, when <hi>Antiochus</hi> (either for pride or pomp of his perſon, or contempt of <hi>Popilius</hi>) refuſed to anſwer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Embaſſador; but was preſently enforced to anſwer the Senate of Rome, and give ſatisfaction to the demands of the Embaſſador, before he might go out of a little round circle which <hi>Popilius</hi> made with his riding Rod. Rome was then faithfull, when <hi>Pomponius</hi> a Roman Knight and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier under <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who was General in the field againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of Pontus, was taken priſoner by <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> and was ſore wounded and mangled, the King deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, If he ſhould give him Quarter for his life, he would be true to <hi>Mithridates?</hi> to whom the poor wounded Roman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Pomponius</hi> will be unto <hi>Mithridates</hi> as <hi>Mithridates</hi> will be unto <hi>Lucullus:</hi> So true and faithfull were Romans, as they were ſtout and valiant, inſomuch that <hi>Scipio</hi> being almoſt thréeſcore years of age, and was deſired by a young ſouldier to buy a brave Buckler, and a fine Target, ſaid, That a true Roman muſt not truſt to the left hand, where the Buckler is, or to hide himſelf under a Target; but muſt truſt to his right hand and ſhow himſelf in field in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſight. This magnanimity had the people of Scythia, at what time <hi>Darius</hi> King of Perſia was marching with his Army towards Scythia, they having intelligence thereof, like people of great magnanimity, ſent certain Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to méet <hi>Darius,</hi> to ſignifie his welcome unto Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia by preſents ſent by their Ambaſſadours: When the Ambaſſadors met with King <hi>Darius,</hi> they began to tel their meſſage, and opening in the privy chamber the Wallet

Though Scythia was bare, yet was ſhe ſtout; though rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, yet valiant and manfull. It is not in the nature of the place, or in the number of the perſons that magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity conſiſteth, but in the valiant heart, and noble mind: Wherefore <hi>Leonides</hi> King of Sparta was wont to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſouldiers that he had rather have one Lion to lead a whole herd of Déers, then to have a whole band of Lions ruled and led by one Déer; applying his meaning unto King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who had ten hundred thouſand ſhips on the Seas ſayling towards Gréece, ſo many as all Gréece could hardly receive ſo many that divers rivers and flouds were dried up by his huge Armie, a proof (ſaith <hi>Juſtine</hi>) more of his wealth then of his magnanimity. <hi>Leonides</hi> (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well the manner of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that he was ſéen firſt in the flight, and laſt in the field; whoſe glorious pomp and numerous army was not ſo famous and terrible at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Gréece, as his departure from Gréece was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ignominious) began ſo perſwade the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, being but four thouſand in number, willingly to die in the ſtreights of <hi>Thermopylae</hi> for the renown of Sparta; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to dine as merrily with <hi>Leonides</hi> their King, as though they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>It is not in multitude of men that magnanimity of men conſiſteth, but in wiſe and valiant hearts, for wit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage joyned together (ſaith <hi>Saluſt</hi>) do make men valiant:

Wherefore <hi>Agamemnon</hi> that moſt renowned Emperour of all Greece at the ſiege of Troy, would often ſay, that he had rather have ten wiſe <hi>Neſtors,</hi> then ten ſtrong as <hi>Achilles,</hi> ten ſuch as <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> then ten ſuch as <hi>Ajax:</hi> wiſedome in war availeth much. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reciteth four famous and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Princes, and either of theſe four had but one eye, to the advancement of their renowned fame, the firſt was <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, and Father unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whoſe wiſedome in wars, whoſe policy in feats, whoſe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity unto his ſouldiers, whoſe clemency and humanity to his enemies, in fine, whoſe ſucceſſe in his affairs were ſuch, that his ſon <hi>Alexande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The women of Scythia called <hi>Amazons,</hi> lived as conquerours over men, and not conquered by men, untill <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them and their Countrey, which before were ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, that they weighed not to encounter with <hi>Hercules</hi> in the field, and after with <hi>Theſeus</hi> in open battel; they bluſhed not to meet the valiant Greeks at the deſtruction of Troy. Magnanimity which was then for the defence of countreys, is now turned into Tyranny to deſtroy countreys: ſo that the toyl and travel, the great dangers, and high attempts that men took in hand, was nothing but a pilgrimage of life; ſome going, ſome comming, ſome born, ſome dying, ſome winning, ſome loſing, ſome beginning their race, and ſome ending their life; much like a Comedy played on ſtages, where every man acteth his appointed part, ſhifting

Inſomuch that to animate the ſouldiers, and to ſtir their Captains with greater courage to defend their countries, they invented glorious triumphs, whereby the deſerved fame of the Conquerours might be renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as the victory of it ſelf was either more or leſſe, ſo were the triumphs appointed to be correſpondent unto the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians a people moſt ſtudious of war, had appointed ſeveral triumphs according unto the ſtate of the victory: for if through deceit or craft, they had gotten a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they would kill a Bull to do ſacrifice unto their Gods. If again through ſtrength and courage they had purchaſed a victory, then in triumph thereof they would kill a Cock. The Athenians at any victory, would crown the Conqueror with a Garland made of Oken leaves, in triumph of his ſucceſſe, properly appointed for him that defended the eſtate of Cities, or the perſons of Citizens: Thus <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> uſed often to triumph in wearing the crown called <hi>Civica Corona,</hi> the <hi>Civick Garland.</hi> This order alſo was obſerved among the Gréeks, that the victors might one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107135:24"/>
make a triumphant ſhew of their victory not to move any enmity, or to maintain diſcord againſt the enemy, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Thebans did, who were of all Gréece with one conſent accuſed, for that they made a perpetual monument of the victory againſt the Lacedemonians to ſtand in braſſe, rather to ſtir enmity and diſcord amongſt their ſucceſſours and poſterity, then juſtly to triumph in their preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The Princes of Carthage uſed ſuch triumphs, as at the yéelding of the Empire of Carthage, by <hi>Haſdrubal</hi> unto his brother <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> who was <hi>Hannibals</hi> father, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times triumphed againſt the Romans. It is read in <hi>Juſtine</hi> that at the beginning the triumphs were not gorgeouſly, nor ſumptuouſly appointed, as they were in proceſſe of time: for the Romans who far excelled all countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had no ſuch triumph when <hi>Romulus</hi> had vanquiſhed <hi>Acron</hi> King of the Senenſes. He did wear nothing elſe but Bay-leaves in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph thereof: for firſt the branches and bows of trées were cut down in triumph. Secondly divers freſh flowers were gathered. Then they invented Garlands made of Time, intermingled with ſilver, and with gold. At length divers kinds of Garlands were ſo uſed in Gréece, that at their banquets and their drinkings they had their Garlands on their heads, for as the world grew in wealth ſo it grew in ſumptuouſneſſe: for the triumph of <hi>Romulus</hi> was far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the gorgeous triumphs of <hi>Camillus,</hi> and yet <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was a King, and <hi>Camillus</hi> was but an Officer. Time bringeth things unto perfection. In time Rome waxed ſo wealthy that <hi>Camillus</hi> I ſay was carried in a Chariot all gilded and wrought over with gold, having all white hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gallantly furniſhed, a Crown of pure Gold on his head, all the Senatours and Conſuls of Rome going on foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him unto the Capitol of the City, and thence unto the Temple of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> where to honour the triumph further, they ſlue a white Bull as a ſacrifice unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and thence he was brought triumphantly unto the City of Rome unto his ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> houſe. Even ſo in Gréece and Carthage, in time they grew into ſuch pomp and ſumptuous triumphs, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107135:25"/>
there was as much ſtudy to invent brave ſhews and ſolemn ſights in triumphs, as there was care and diligence to have removed the enemies: when <hi>Epaminondas</hi> ruled ſtately Thebes; when <hi>Hannibal</hi> governed proud Carthage; when <hi>Leonidas</hi> bare ſway in war like Sparta: then Gréece and Lydia were acquainted with ſolemn and brave triumphs. In <hi>Ninus</hi> time the triumphs were in Aſſyria. In <hi>Arbaces</hi> time the triumphs flouriſhed amongſt the Medes. In <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> time the triumphs were in <hi>Perſia.</hi> In <hi>Alexanders</hi> time they were in Macedonia. In <hi>Caeſars</hi> time they were in Rome, and thus alwaies from the beginning of the world, triumphs followed victories. And here I mean a little to intreat of the triumphs of the Romans, which far divers ways ſurmounted the reſt, whoſe Fame was ſpread over all the world: and yet imitating in all things the Gréeks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Rome alwaies had Athens as a Nurſe, or a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to frame their laws by: for although the Kings were baniſhed as well in Athens as in Rome, yet they ruled and triumphed more by Orateurs in Athens, and by Conſuls in Rome, then by Kings. Therefore as <hi>Plini</hi> ſaith they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed ſuch feats of arms they contrived ſuch policies, they uſed ſuch ſolemnities in triumphs, that Rome then was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the lamp and lanthorn of <hi>Mars.</hi> They had (I ſay) divers Garlands made onely for the triumphs of wars: <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> counteth ſeven ſorts of Garlands, which the Romans had: the firſt made of pure gold, appointed onely for the triumphs of Princes: The ſecond of Laurell, which of all was moſt ancient in Gréece, and in Italy appointed for the triumphs of ſouldiers: The third of all kind of ſwéet flowers, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him that reſtored Cities to their liberties again: The fourth made of Oken leaves, to him that defended Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens from death: theſe two Garlands were of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in Rome, but eſpecially in Gréece the one <hi>Cicero</hi> wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for him that aſſaulted the walls of the enemies firſt, and entred the town: The ſixth for him that attempted the tents of the enemies: The ſeventh beſtowed upon him that boarded firſt the Navie of the enemy. Theſe three laſt Garlands mentioned for the ſcaling of walls, the boarding ſhips, and attempting the tents, were made all of gold. and given by the Princes or Senatours to the aforeſaid Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</p>
               <p>There was likewiſe in Rome a decrée concerning the triumphs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none might triumph unleſs he had béen before ſome Officer in Rome, as <hi>Dictator, Pretor, Conſul,</hi> or ſuch like: and if any (unleſs by the Senate) had won any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, though their conqueſt were never ſo great, and their victorie never ſo famous (as <hi>Pub. Scipio</hi> for all his victories in Spain, and <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> for all that he took the great City of Syracuſe) they might in no wiſe by Law make any claim of Triumphs, becauſe they were not appointed by the Senator. Then Rome flouriſhed and was defended from divers injuries, and ſaved from enemies. At what time <hi>M.

               <p>That victory that was not manfully gotten, and valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly won in the field, was rather counted tyranny then victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For when <hi>Lucius Pius</hi> in a banquet that he made, had filled the people of Sarmatia full of wine, and made them ſo drunk, that all the Nobles and Captains of Sarmatia yéelded themſelves as ſubjects unto the Empire of Rome, for which at his return home to Rome, he required accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome, to have a triumph done unto him for the victory of Sarmatia; the Senators having underſtood
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107135:26"/>
the manner of the victory, and how, and after what ſort <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Pius</hi> ſubdued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sarmatians, he was openly beheaded by decrée of all the Senate, and a ſlanderous Epitaph ſet upon his grave, to manifeſt the deceit he uſed in ſtead of magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, that he deceived them by wine, whom he ought to have ſubdued by force. The Romans were not in thoſe days contented that any of their Captains ſhould uſe vicious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or ſhew any fraud or guile in wars unto their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but at laſt as wars grew common in all Countreys, ſo deceit and craft was thereby augmented, and triumph exiled: Then the Aſſyrians warred on the Perſians, the Perſians on the Argineans, the Argineans on the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Athenians on the Lacedemonians the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians on the Sydonians the Sydonians on the Rhodians, and the Rhodians on the Scythians, with all kind of policy, right or wrong they cared not, ſo that victory were gotten: So that the triumph then, is now turned into captivity; magnanimity then, unto craft and deceit now; In fine, victory then unto tyranny now. And ſo with <hi>Caeſar</hi> I end, <hi>Ex bonis principtis mala or iuntur.</hi> Such is the ſtate of life, the pilgrimage of man which is daily worſe and worſe as it waxeth to the end: For in the beginning, renown and honour was the cauſe that all men attempted dangers and great perils, and now in the end, gain and profit moveth wars; then was their deſire to overcome Lions, Bears, Elephants Tygers, Panthers, Rhinocerots, and ſuch wild and ſavage beaſts that might renown their atchievements, and now for the moſt part forgotten, they deſcend into the Vale of Death.</p>

                  <p> Of the firſt finding out of Laws and Orders, and of all invention of things general, and of Time,</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He world growing into its maturity, divers men found means to ſet things in order, which at the beginning were rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous; as amongſt the Athenians, <hi>Draco;</hi> amongſt the Egyptians, <hi>Mercury;</hi> amongſt the Argives, <hi>Phoroneus;</hi> In Arcadia, <hi>Apollo;</hi> in Tyre, <hi>Charandes;</hi> in Italy, <hi>Pythagoras:</hi> Other things no leſſe neceſſary for the manners and civility of men, then for the life and food of men, were found. And becauſe Time is the beginning and end of all things terreſtrial. I think it expedient in this place to declare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>putation of Times and Ages: For with the Egyptians at the firſt, they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their years by the Moon, attributing unto every year thirty days, as both <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> do agrée. The The Arcadians as <hi>Putarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Numa</hi> doth write, had three moneths in every year appointed. The people of Caria finiſhed and ended their year every ſixth Moneth. The Greeks did number three hundred fifty and four days in their years, which want of our years eleven days and ſix hours. The Romans at the beginning in the time of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> who was their firſt King, had their year in ten Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths compted, counting their firſt moneth March and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that name unto it after his fathers name <hi>Mars;</hi> April was named of <hi>Aphros</hi> in Greek, which is Fome, whence <hi>Venus</hi> was born: May was called <hi>a Majoribus,</hi> of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Iune of the youth called <hi>Juniores:</hi> Theſe four were of <hi>Romulus</hi> named. The fifth moneth was then called by <hi>Romulus, Quintil,</hi> which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in his time na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Iuly. and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> named the moneth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sexulis,</hi> Auguſt; and ſo in order, September, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, November, December. <hi>Numa Pompunus,</hi> who ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Romulus,</hi> added Ianuary and February, and ſo named
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107135:27"/>
them according to the name of <hi>Janus,</hi> who was the firſt King of the Latines, and <hi>Februus</hi> who was ſuppoſed to be the inventer of the Luſtration: For as the Greeks did count all things by their <hi>Olympiades,</hi> ſo did the Romans by their <hi>Luſtra.</hi> Then was the uſe of Clocks unknown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Authors herein do much vary, and ſeem to be ignorant of the inventers of them. Firſt, ſome think that <hi>Herme,</hi> in Egypt found them out by a beaſt ſacrificed unto <hi>Seraphis;</hi> ſome again attribute the invention unto <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> in Lacedemonia, and that they were found out by a ſhade; ſome unto <hi>Scipio</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Naſica</hi> in Rome, by a water: But uncertain it is by whom, and by what means Clocks firſt were found. Some again do count their day, which is four and twenty hours, from ſun riſing unto ſun riſing, as the Babylonians uſe; ſome from ſun ſetting to ſun ſetting, as the Athenians; ſome from midnight to midnight as the Egyptians; ſome again from midnight to noon again, as the Vmbrians do: Thus diverſly have hours and days been counted.</p>
               <p>Now after laws were invented, and orders made, and time divided, men as yet rude and raw, leading their lives beaſtly and bruitiſhly, for want of civility, having neither houſes, Towns, or Cities, to inhabit, but ſome having in Caves of the ground their chief manſions, others had their beſt garments made of green bows and branches of trées, ſome hid themſelves in ſhadows of the woods, ſome in Dens like wild beaſts, untill nature firſt by reaſon opened a way and a means thus unto further civility. Then houſes were made, and Cities builded, high towers raiſed, ſtrong walls invented: King <hi>Cerops</hi> erected Athens: <hi>Phoroneus</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Argos: Dioſpolin in Egypt was by <hi>Threſon</hi> builded. Likewiſe the firſt tower after the deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> was made by <hi>Nimrod;</hi> then Temples were builded <hi>Pythias</hi> in <hi>Perenna</hi> made a temple unto <hi>Minerva: Romulus</hi> in Rome builded a temple unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and thus divers men in ſundry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have béen the builders of monuments. By this means came <hi>Pallas</hi> unto great fame, for that ſhe was ſuppoſed to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107135:27"/>
the firſt that invented ſciences, amongſt the Grecians in <hi>Athens;</hi> for this purpoſe was <hi>Ceres</hi> in <hi>Sicilia</hi> renowned, for that ſhe was thought to be the firſt that ſowed corn, and taught husbandry, for this reaſon were <hi>Typhis</hi> and <hi>Jaſon</hi> ſo worthily commended, that they among the Gréeks were the firſt that ſailed the ſeas. Then was money found in Mount <hi>Pangaeum,</hi> and coined in <hi>Aegineta,</hi> which as <hi>Plini</hi> ſaith had béen better unknown then found; money being found wars inſued by <hi>Ninus,</hi> who was the firſt that ever warred after the deluge Then Idolatry ſprung up by <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the Lacedemonians people of great antiquity, found firſt the Helmet, a Sword and a Spear, the Scythians found firſt the uſe of Bows and Arrows; the Thracians were ancient in feats of chivalry; for that <hi>Mars</hi> as they ſuppoſed was born with them, who was honoured as the God of wars, and found out divers things neceſſary for wars, Happy was that man that might then invent ſomething or other to profit his country: and thus the wit of man ſought ſo déeply, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo painfully, that from a rude and lumpiſh Chaos, the world waxed beautifull, and men waxed civil, and all things became ripe and perfect by the induſtry of man. Afterwards the world grew unto ſuch ripeneſſe, that liberal ſciences were found and uſed in all places, as things neceſſary unto man, and there was nothing unſought that might induce profit: both hearbs, ſtones, trées, and all things within the compaſſe of the earth were ſearched to what end they were and uſed accordingly unto ſome purpoſe. <hi>Vulcanus</hi> and <hi>Promotheus</hi> found out the profit of the fire, <hi>Anacharſis</hi> the Scythian firſt found bellows to blow the ſame; as <hi>Ceres</hi> taught to plough the ground, <hi>Argeus</hi> did invent the dunging of it. <hi>Urania</hi> found firſt Aſtrologie, the people of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> ſtraight practiſed the ſame. <hi>Errato</hi> invented the uſe of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry,

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought it convenient to place the ſtrange and wonderful buildings, which were made by mens hands, together with the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works of nature; and the rather becauſe amongſt them are ſo famous, that for the renown thereof, they are named in number the ſeven wonders of the world. The firſt was called Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides, which the Kings of Egypt made by the City of Memphis, a miracle ſo made, that twenty and two yeares, ſix thouſand were occupyed and travelled in the ſame: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, to buſie the vulgar people leſt they ſhould be idle, or elſe to ſhew and brag their ſuperfluous wealth in making ſo ſtupendious a work. The ſecond, were the walls of Babylon, which Quéene <hi>Semiramis</hi> unto her perpetuall memory had made a monument amongſt the Perſians. In making of theſe walls, ſhe kept three hundred thouſand men at work, they were made of two hundred cubits height and fifty cubits broad, having a hundred gates, wrought of braſſe round about, to come and go unto the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and from the City: And upon the walls were made three hundred towers: ſhe brought <hi>Euphrates</hi> one of the foure Rivers of Paradiſe to paſſe through the middeſt of Babylon. The third in order was the ſumptuous tombe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107135:29"/>
of <hi>Mauſolus</hi> King of Caria, which Quéene <hi>Artemeſia</hi> his wife made ſo gorg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eous, that it was twenty and five Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, and in compaſſe foure hundred and eleven foot, and wrought round about with ſixe and thirty pillars and broad beames: hence all the monuments and brave build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Emperours and Kings took their patterne, for it was ſo curiouſly wrought, that upon the Eaſt ſide, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous workman <hi>Scopas</hi> ſhewed his ſkill: upon the Weſt ſide that renowned <hi>Leocares</hi> wrought his cunning: upon the North ſide <hi>Briax</hi> a man of great name applyed his part: and upon the South ſide <hi>Timotheus</hi> did what he could to winne renowne. Theſe foure famous workmen had more fame by making the tombe of <hi>Mauſolus,</hi> then for all the workes that ever they made before. Theſe two noble Quéenes are not to be blotted out of memory all the while that the name of Babylon is reade of in bookes, or the Tombe of <hi>Mauſolus</hi> ſpoken off with tongues. Now to paſſe further to ſpeake of that monument and miracle which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all the world for worke, I meane the great Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> amongſt the Epheſians, in the building of which all Aſia were occupyed two hundred and twenty yeares, almoſt with all powers of the world. This Temple was made nigh the ſeas for feare of earthquakes: it was foure hundred twenty and five foote long, two hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foote of breadth, it had a hundred twenty and ſeven pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which for the wealth thereof, every one after another was made by a king, The cheife maſter of this worke was <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> whoſe fame thereby was ſpread over all the world The fifth was the high tower which King <hi>Pcholome</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de in the Iſle of <hi>Pharos,</hi> to benefit the ſaylors upon the Seas. This <hi>Soſtratus</hi> made ſo high, that in the night time there hanged a Candle for a light and marke unto poore Mariners, which could be ſéene for the height of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer almoſt every where. The other two and laſt of the ſeven wonders, were two Images, the one for <hi>Iupiter,</hi> made by <hi>Phydias,</hi> of Ivory in <hi>Olimpia.</hi> The other made for <hi>Phaebus</hi> in Rhodes, by <hi>Lindus,</hi> whoſe immenſity was ſuch,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107135:29"/>
that it was threeſcore and ten Cubits high: ſo great was this Coloſſus, that when it fell downe by an earthquake, it ſéemed a wonder to the beholders: every finger that he had was bigger then a man of this age. Theſe ſeven huge and monſtrous workes were called the ſeven wonders of the world, which <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaketh of in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Some ſuppoſe that the royall Pallace of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which that cunning workman <hi>Memnon</hi> made, might bee iuſtlie numbred with theſe worthy and famous works. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed to other ſumptuous buildings, though not counted of the ſeven wonders, yet allowed amongſt the beſt for the ſtately worke of the ſame, and of no inferiour fame: as the Laberinth made by <hi>Dedalus</hi> in Creete, of ſuch difficult worke, that he that came in, could not without a guide goe out againe. Three others were made like unto that, the one in Egypt which <hi>Smilus</hi> made, the other in Lemnos which <hi>Rhodus</hi> wrought, and the third in Italy which <hi>Theodorus</hi> made. Theſe foure Labyrinthes were ſo curiouſly wrought, that <hi>Porſenna</hi> king of Hetruria took hence example to make him a monument after death, to bury and eternize himſelfe. Againe, after theſe there were other wonderfull workes made by the kings of Egypt called <hi>Obeliſci,</hi> ſuch renowned and famous buildings that when <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> king of Perſia. at the ſiege of the city Sienna ſaw but one of them hee was in ſuch an admiration that hee thought them invincible. <hi>Phyus</hi> made one of forty cubits.

his great warres made a city of his name, named Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. I muſt not forget King <hi>Darius,</hi> who likewiſe built up Suſa a city in Perſia. Theſe two kings, though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thouſands of cities, yet they builded ſome cities. Neither may I omit <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> who made a famous city in memory of the great victory over <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> and named it Nicopalis, that is in engliſh the city of victory King <hi>Ninus,</hi> an ancient King, made the city of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive,</hi> within two hundred yeares after the flood of <hi>Noah, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> builded Sidon: <hi>Agenor</hi> Tyre. Then the world waxed populous, and kings began to build every where for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of civility, and encreaſe of pollicy and wit, in which the world in the beginning was very raw: for as the world grew into civill order and the knowledge of things: ſo cities and townes were builded.

For painting unto the ignorant, was as printing unto the learned. Where the one viewed with the eye, and the other read with the tongue. Painting and graving were the ancient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gréece, and ſo much eſtéemed, that <hi>Phrydias</hi> waxt ſo famous, as <hi>Plini</hi> doth witneſſe, for that he made the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Minerva</hi> in Athens, ſo artificially and ſo ſubtilly, with a great Target in her hand, wherein were graven the wars of the Amazons, and the combat of the Giants: the rebellion of Centaures and the Lapitheans, that all Gréece wondred much thereat. <hi>Nealces</hi> in like ſort did ſet forth the wars betwixt the Egyptians and the Perſians, ſo lively to behold, and ſo worthily wrought; that the beholder thereof might be as well inſtructed in ſight, as the learned in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hiſtory thereof.

ſadneſſe of the ſacrifice, the order and ſtate of of <hi>Iphigenias</hi> death, did ſo ſet it forth, that it was more lamentable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it in colours then rufull to read it in letters.

What almoſt was done or written in Gréece, but it was ſtreight ſet forth in colours? No war any were, but it it was painted out in Greece. No ſtrange hiſtory of any thing but it was expreſſed in common colours: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that philoſophy it ſelf, which was ſo honoured then in Greece, was ſet forth in Tables.

At what time King <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, the long enemy of Athens, had demanded upon condition of peace, ten Orators of Athens to ſerve him, and to remain with him in Macedonia, <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that ſugred Orator, made an open Oration before King <hi>Philip,</hi> where he brought the fable of the Woolf and the Sheep that as the Woolf did offer peace unto the Sheep upon condition the dogs ſhould tarry at home: ſo King <hi>Philip</hi> offered peace unto the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians upon conditions that the Orators, which as dogs do bark at the Woolf, barked at him, ſhould be taken away, and ſo ſoon he would deſtroy Athens being ſpoiled from their Orators, as the Woolf would the ſheep without dogs.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107135:32"/>
This fable much edifieth the vulgar people. <hi>Menenius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> a Romane Counſellour, rehearſed oftentimes the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the belly and the other members, when he went to make any foes friends, or to bring rude rebels againſt their Prince and their countrey, unto amity again. With the which fable he reduced and brought againe thoſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended moſt againſt their countrey, to be the chief aſſiſtance and helpers unto their countrey. <hi>Thucidides</hi> doth witneſſe, that by a fable, that noble Captaine <hi>Peticles</hi> put ſuch a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage into the Athenians, being ſore oppreſſed and vexed, and in a manner become a ſpoyle unto their enemies, that they did winne the victory, when before they were almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. The noble Conſul <hi>Cicero,</hi> by the fable of <hi>Giges</hi> ring, how he went inviſible unto King <hi>Candaules</hi> wife, and made him a cuckold, made application of it unto thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons that often delight in their folly and evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours, as ſometimes the Poets faine of <hi>Ixion,</hi> who brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and boaſting of <hi>Juno,</hi> he got the centaurs engendred of a cloud in ſtead of <hi>Juno, Quintilian</hi> ſaith, that fables con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine under feigned words, moſt excellent wiſedome: for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus</hi> doth often repeat the fable of graſhoppers and the ants, to exhort men to travel and to labour with little ants. <hi>Plato</hi> that divine and noble Philoſopher, in his ſecond book, <hi>de Rep.</hi> doth uſe the like fables. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Rhetorick doth uſe fables.

               <p>Such is the excellency of eloquence, that it moveth as well men to behold for the geſture, countenance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, as it doth inforce men to hear for the Majeſty and ſweetneſſe of words. For <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was not ſo eloquent in words, but he was as comely in geſture, and ſo excellent in either of them, that when he ſpake before the people, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and Citizens of Rome, they were no leſs enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſight then they were allured and enticed with his words; for he laboured no leſſe outwardly to pleaſe the times, then he ſtudied inwardly to pleaſe men, Therefore <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> the Well and ſource of flowing eloquence, being demanded what was the chief part of eloquence, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that it was pronunciation; again, being demanded what was the ſecond part of eloquence, he ſaid pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And ſo the third time being likewiſe demanded, ſaid as before, pronunciation: Inſomuch that he travelled and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107135:34"/>
ſtudied oftentimes to have this pronunciation, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by nature letted to ſpeak, putting ſtones in the roof of his mouth, and wraſtling with nature until he had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of pronunciation. When <hi>Aeſchines</hi> had forſaken A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens for certain cauſes, and was come unto Rhodes, whoſe fame for his eloquence was ſpread not onely in Rhodes, but well known in all Greece: after he was deſired by the Citizens to recite ſome Oration or other, of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, whereby the Rhodians might ſée and hear that which long before of all men they heard praiſed: He to ſatisfie the requeſt of the City, repeated an Oration that he made againſt <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> wherein the people of Rhodes muſed much at his eloquence: And when he had ended his own Oration that he inveighed againſt <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> to put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a greater admiration of eloquence, he recited another Oration that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> made in the defence of <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> againſt <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> wherein the people were amazed at the eloquence of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> more then at the firſt: Which when <hi>Aeſchines</hi> ſaw that his enemy <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was ſo prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (for they were one envious of another he was enforced to ſpeak, that if the Rhodians might but hear <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> himſelf, then would they rightly praiſe him, ſince they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> Oration in <hi>Aeſchines</hi> mouth; for no man hath ſo great a delight to tell another mans ſtory, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his enemies, as he hath pleaſure to ſet forth his own. <hi>Plato</hi> therefore that famous Gréek, attributing unto every man due honour, when certain men skilfull in Geometry, came to ask <hi>Plato</hi>'s counſel concerning the meaſure quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and longitude of things, he counſelled them to go unto <hi>Euclides,</hi> where they ſhould be ſufficed and fully ſatisfied of their demands, for that <hi>Euclides</hi> might more aptly ſpeak in Geometry, for it was his profeſſion. For every man, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> may boldly ſpeak in that which he profeſſeth; and therefore <hi>Apelles</hi> that noble and cunning Painter, when a Shoomaker came unto his ſchoole, and féeding his fight with the worthy works of <hi>Apelles,</hi> he found fault with a latchet of a ſhoe, <hi>Apelles,</hi> becauſe he was a Shomaker, gave

him place and amended it. The ſecond day the Shoomaker came again, and found fault in the hoſe; then <hi>Apelles</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, that a Shoemaker ought not to judge of any thing but of the ſhoe.</p>
               <p>Every man that thinketh himſelf eloquent, for that he hath his tongue at will, and can ſhift matters skilfully in his own judgement, is not that eloquent man which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaketh of, nor hath thoſe parts of Rhetorick where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee can perſwade to good, and diſſwade from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.

of all is not to be known. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> therefore, King of the Lacedemonians, underſtanding that the inhabitants of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very country in all Gréece, had decréed to put up the picture of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> for a memorial of his vertuous and noble acts, to be as monuments of his life after death: returning then from Egypt unto Gréece, being very ſick, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, he wrote letters unto Gréece, that they ſhould make no pictures no images no painted ſhews, no graven work of his perſon, nor yet of his life, ſaying: If I have done well in life, the vertue thereof is a ſufficient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when I am dead. <hi>Cato Senior</hi> was of that opinion, that he had rather that men ſhould ask why hath not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> his Picture ſet up, then to asks why hath <hi>Cato</hi> his picture ſet up. A number of ſage Philoſophers and wiſe Princes have lothed and utterly neglected this kind of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which then was thought to be the greateſt fame and commendation of all things, to have their pictures in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſet up to make mention of honour and dignity which thereby is meant, either for reſtoring of liberty loſt, or in defending from tyranny, or in ſaving of Cities, or for ſuch things done, pictures were erected to advance their fame thereby. Thus <hi>Ariſtogiton</hi> and <hi>Armodius,</hi> becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Athens from the tyranny of <hi>Pyſiſtratus,</hi> had their pictures, with great eſtimation ſet up of the people of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Likewiſe <hi>Marcellus</hi> becauſe he ſubdued Syracuſa, vanquiſhed the French men at Padua, and gave the repulſe unto <hi>Hannibal</hi> at Nola, had his picture ſet up in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> with an Epigram written in letters of gold, unto his great praiſe and commendation. <hi>Eutropius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Claudius</hi> Emperour of Rome had his picture made with a golden Target in his hand, becauſe he vanquiſhed the Goths which were about to ſpoil the county of Macedonia. <hi>Numa Pomp.</hi> the ſecond King of Rome, and <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> the ſixth King had their pictures a long time amongſt the Romans in great honour and fame. <hi>Seloſtris</hi> King of Egypt for his martial feats and vertuous acts was honoured in his country with divers pictures. <hi>Polydamas</hi> that ſtrong
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107135:36"/>
Champion in the games of <hi>Olympia,</hi> for that he being without weapons and naked, ſlew a terrible Lyon, and held faſt by the foot a huge great Bull, and with the other hand ſtayed a running Chariot, had his picture therefore erected and ſet up in <hi>Olympia.</hi> In Athens how many pictures were ſet up of noble men and learned Philoſophers, as <hi>Conon Euogoras, Phocion, Iſocrates</hi> and others, which were now up and now down as mutable fortune favoured or frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſtate and life of men being uncertain and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. As <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> having his picture in Athens had this Epigram written round about the picture. If <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had had courage and ſtrength as he had wit and eloquence, neither <hi>Philip</hi> nor his ſon <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor all Macedonia had ever vanquiſhed Gréece: yet this <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was exiled and baniſhed Athens divers times. So hard was it to pleaſe the people then, which had the chief government in Athens and Rome, that for a ſmall diſpleaſure conceived, yea for nothing, they were ready to requite good men with cruel déeds, as baniſhment and death. As in Rome, <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> for <hi>Clodius</hi> ſake, after ſure and ſound ſervice often ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward his country, was afterward inforced to flee unto Greece from Rome, where ſo well he was before eſtéemed. The like I may urge of <hi>Ariſtides, Thraſibulus, Hippias,</hi> and <hi>Thucidides,</hi> men ſometimes honoured in Athens with pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, for the noble and excellent defence of the City, and yet for nothing not long after exiled, the pictures taken down, and the monuments broken.

Such is the uncertain pilgrimage of man the wandring ways of the world, the mutability of fortune, as there hath béen full proof ſhewed of the ſame from time to time in all places, in baniſhing, in murthering yea, again in worſhipping and honouring. As for example, we read that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was born in Pella, a town in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, and died in Babylon. King <hi>Cyrus</hi> was born in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107135:36"/>
Perſia, and ſlain in Scythia; <hi>Hannibal</hi> born in <hi>Affrick</hi> and buried in Bithinia; <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans born in the City of Sparta, yet his grave was made in Egypt. <hi>Craſtus</hi> and <hi>Pompeius</hi> the great, born in Rome: the one died in Aſſyria, the other in Egypt. <hi>Paulus Aenilius</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Cinna.

So in Athens <hi>Themiſtocles, Theſeus Solon</hi> were flouriſhing with others: yet in Syria, Cyprus, and Perſia, were they buried. King <hi>Jugurtha</hi> born in Numidia, was buried in Rome. Again King <hi>Aegeus</hi> born in Athens, <hi>Pharao</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>Ajax</hi> in Gréece, <hi>Leander</hi> in Abidos: yet their graves and burial was in the bottome of the ſea.

well ſeem too tedious to moleſt the Reader with them. I will therefore in this place ſpeak of the diligence and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell of poor men, who by their ſtudy and labour became lamps of light unto the world. And to begin with <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> two baſe men of birth, whoſe diligence in their life, made them moſt famous being dead, the one the ſon of a poor Citizen of Athens named <hi>Ariſton:</hi> the other the ſon of a poor Marbler named <hi>Sophroniſeus.</hi> Might not poor <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rictione</hi> the mother of <hi>Plato,</hi> be proud of her ſon, when the greateſt tyrant in the world, that proud Prince <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> would honour and reverence him for his learning and knowledge, and take him into a Chariot as a Prince, and not as a poor Philoſopher? Might not that poor midwife named <hi>Phanaerara</hi> rejoyce to have ſuch a ſon as <hi>Socrates,</hi> who being eſtéemed of all men to be beſt learned, being counted of all men moſt Orthodor, and taken of all men to be moſt modeſt, and moſt grave, was alſo judged by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Apollo</hi> to be the wiſeſt in all the world.

Thus diligence and travel brought them to fame, that being poor men, they were honoured of rich men, being baſe men they were exalted of Princes. Oh happy countries of ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men! oh happy women of ſuch children! Oh twice happy children of ſuch learning and knowledge! The poor Smith which was <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> father, and the ſilly Potter who was <hi>Virgils</hi> father, are more renowned by their children this day being dead, then known by their own wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive.

and tuition of that renowned Conqueror <hi>Alexander</hi> five years together, who was honoured of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and not onely eſteemed of King <hi>Philip,</hi> but Athens being deſtroyed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> it was reſtored by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Such was the diligence of men, their care and induſtries, that their large volumns and infinite books, are witneſs of their well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied minds. How became <hi>Plutarch</hi> Maſter to <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperor? How was <hi>Seneca</hi> appointed the Tutor and Schoolmaſter of the Emperor <hi>Nero?</hi> How came <hi>Zeno</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch favour with King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> but by diligence, and not by idleneſs; by travel, and not by ſlothfulneſs; by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not by ignorance. Why did that great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Roman <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Affricanus,</hi> eſteem ſo much the poor Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> alive, that being dead, he cauſed his picture to be ſet before his eys, as a pledge of his great love and earneſt good will? It was for the deſert that <hi>Scipio</hi> found in <hi>Ennius.</hi> Why did <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> that wiſe and Godly Emperor, make ſo much of <hi>Maro</hi>'s books? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was in his time the lamp of Rome, he honoured no leſſe his books after he was dead, then he embraced him alive. The great King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> thought himſelf half dead without the company of <hi>Hippocrates. Pomponius Atticus</hi> did think him happy, when either <hi>Cicero</hi> was in his ſight, or ſome of his books in his boſome. <hi>Alexander</hi> never went to bed without <hi>Homer</hi> under his pillow. Who will not praiſe the diligence of poor <hi>Cleanthes</hi> the Philoſopher? Who will not commend the travel of <hi>Plautus</hi> the comical Poet? the one living with a Baker, the other with a Bruer, with much care and pain in the day time, that they might ſtudy in the night time. Such was their poverty and neceſſity, that they were urged to labour in the day ſuch was their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and deſire unto learning, that they were willing to ſtudy in the day time.</p>
               <p>Who will not extol <hi>Euclides</hi> to take ſuch pains, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ſuch danger, to go in the night time in the apparel of a woman, becauſe he might not be known, to hear <hi>Socrates</hi> read Philoſophy? Oh painfull men, Oh worthy members
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107135:40"/>
of their country that ſo ſought by diligence, that ſo travelled by ſtudy and induſtry: and in fine ſo found by wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the redreſſe of things, to diſperſe that diffuſed Chaos, which Time ſaid <hi>Cicero</hi> had then ſcant opened the doore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Then after private pain and ſpecial ſtudy of ſundry men in ſeveral countries, knowledg came to that perfection, that from one man in one place, divers grew learned and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. Thus from <hi>Romulus</hi> the firſt builder and King of the Romans, Rome in ſhort time had wiſe and diſcréet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours to govern the City. From <hi>Solon</hi> the firſt law-giver (after <hi>Draco</hi>) amongſt the Athenians, by and by, learned and eloquent Oratours flouriſhed in Athens. From <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> amongſt the Lacedemonians, ſtraight grew modeſt and grave Senators called Ephori. And thus from one in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning divers procéeded forth in the end: Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets began amongſt the Egyptians: the Gimnoſophiſtes among the Indians: the Caldeans amongſt the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Sages called Magi, amongſt the Perſians: And ſo of others in other countries. And thus by diligence, were all men firſt commended by their pilgrimage and labour of life, and were well recorded in memory for their ſervice to their countrey, Prince, and friends, that ſo having finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their pilgrimage in this life, the fame of their merits were a perpetual memory to them after death.</p>

This Nature wrought in divers men in ſundry countries a deſire to knowledge, whereby men exerciſed their gifts to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and commendation of their countries, following
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107135:41"/>
as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, Nature as a good guide, and a Captaine to finde out that which was not known. And becauſe nature was alwayes deſirous to be acquainted with art, as a thing to exornate and beautifie her ſelfe, ſhe firſt invented letters as the foundation and the ground whence all learning doth procéed. Afterwards letters were invented amongſt the Hebrews by <hi>Phylo,</hi> and brought unto Gréece by <hi>Cadmus,</hi> and practiſed firſt in Egypt by <hi>Memnon:</hi> from Egypt unto Phrygia, brought by one named <hi>Hercules</hi> an Egyptian born. Again, among the Hetruſcans letters were firſt invented and written by <hi>Demaratus</hi> a Corinthian. Amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes as both <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> do affirm the Pilagians invented letters, and taught the uſe thereof. And ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of great credit, affirm that <hi>Nicoſtrata</hi> the mother of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> the Areadian invented letters firſt in Rome. So <hi>Radamanthus</hi> in Syria, and ſo others in divers places of the world were ſtudious and carefull to ſearch a way by reaſon to practiſe the ſame by wit, and to diſperſe the lumpiſh Chaos, which yet for want of knowledge had no perfect forme. And now letters being invented. Grammer worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to claime the ſecond ſeat of fame whoſe beginning and entrance unto Rome, was celebrated by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> brought by one <hi>Crates,</hi> being ſent as Ambaſſador from king <hi>Attalus,</hi> unto the Senatours, at the time of the ſecond wars of Carthage. This is the well, whence flow all other ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for from the faculty of writing, and the art of ſpeaking, do the reſt procéed. <hi>Macrobius</hi> preferreth <hi>Dydimus</hi> for his excellency herein. <hi>Cicero</hi> commendeth one named <hi>Antonius Enipho,</hi> whoſe ſchoole and lecture <hi>Cicero</hi> long frequented. The force of Grammer chiefly conſiſteth in Hiſtories and Poetry; for Poetry is ſo commended, that both <hi>Moſes</hi> that mighty ruler of the Hebrews, and <hi>David</hi> that wiſe Prince of Iſrael, the one in reducing the people from Egypt, the red Sea opening a way, and giving place unto <hi>Moſes</hi> to paſſe through, made Exemetron verſes in good méeters, to thank God for his good ſucceſſe and fortune; the other with divers Hymns in méeter, and ſwéet ſongs did aſſwage the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107135:41"/>
juſt anger of God for his offences. In Poetry <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiodus</hi> excelled for antiquity, the one in ſetting forth the fame of <hi>Mars,</hi> (I mean wars) the other in commending the pains and diligence of <hi>Ceres,</hi> (which is husbandry) though <hi>Lynus Orpheus, Marcellinus</hi> and others were of great antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet not of ſo great a fame. Hiſtories and the profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were found, as <hi>Plyny</hi> writeth, by <hi>Cadmus Myleſius</hi> the firſt Hiſtory that was written by any Phyloſopher, was by <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon:</hi> but the excellent and worthy fame of Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in Gréece afterward was juſtly noted in <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as it was amongſt the Romanes in <hi>Livi</hi> and <hi>Saluſt.</hi> Thus from a rude beginning, came famous and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writers.</p>
               <p>As for Rethorick, it was firſt invented by <hi>Mercury,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith, but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> do think, it was by <hi>Empedoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es:</hi> then from time to time from age to age, it came unto that perfection at length that Rethorick was as neceſſary to be taught every where, as it was profitable to be uſed any where. The Prince of this faculty in Gréece; was <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who with his eloquence long guided A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. <hi>Iſocrates, Aeſchines</hi> and others flouriſhed in great fame by this art in Gréece. In Rome <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Saluſt.</hi> were the fountaines of all ſugred eloquence. For the beginning of Muſicke, divers opinions and ſundry aſſertions are made, where Muſick was firſt found. The Gréeks ſuppoſe that <hi>Dioniſius</hi> found firſt Muſick. The Hebrews think that <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, Polibius</hi> ſaith, that Muſick firſt was found in Arcadia, <hi>Solinus</hi> ſaith, that it was firſt in Créet. The moſt do agree and judge, that <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Linus</hi> were the inventors of it, ſome again think that <hi>Amphyon</hi> found Muſick: but how. where and when it was firſt found it is uncertaine. But unto that perfection at length Muſick came, that the Gréeks thought that man not well learned, unleſſe he had ſome skil in Muſick. As for the golden ſtudy of Phyloſophy, which as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, ſearcheth wiſedome hateth folly, the only ſeeker of vertues, and the ſcourge of vices; ſome ſuppoſe that it was firſt from the barbarous people brought unto Greece,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107135:42"/>
for amongſt the ancient Egyptians, Philoſophy was firſt ſtudied and opened by <hi>Vulcanus.</hi> Amongſt the Perſians it was found by them that were called <hi>Magi.</hi> Amongſt the Indians by <hi>Gymnoſophiſtes.</hi> Amongſt the Babylonians, and Aſſyrians by the Caldeans, which as <hi>Laertius</hi> doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, were called all wiſe men. This art was ſought with great induſtry, and much honoured in all the world, for that it contained all ſciences and faculties in it ſelf, as well the life and manners of men, as alſo the obſcure and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult nature of things, with the ſubtil ſearch of the ſame in the diſputation thereon. Great was the contention of the Aſtrologers who was he that firſt found the orders and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavens: ſome attributing the firſt invention thereof unto <hi>Prometheus,</hi> ſome unto <hi>Belus;</hi> ſome unto <hi>Atlas,</hi> as <hi>Plini</hi> in his ſeventh book affirmeth wherefore the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets fain that <hi>Atlas</hi> doth ſuſtain the heavens upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſome attribute it unto <hi>Mercurius,</hi> ſome unto <hi>Actinus.</hi> And thus every country contendeth about the antiquity thereof. The Egyptians brag of their antiquity upon this ſubject; the Aſſyrians boaſt no leſſe of their knowledge in this art. The courſe of the Moon was firſt found by <hi>Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion.</hi> The eclipſe of the ſame by <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> Thus firſt nature ſought ſuch means as might ſet forth her deſire by ſéeking and travelling for knowledge; And phyſick is not ſo little to be eſtéemed but it might here well be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſidering the common profit thereof, and how painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame was ſtudied by others in time paſt.</p>
               <p>Phiſick is either healing with diet, medicine, or ſugery. In the firſt <hi>Apollo</hi> was moſt honoured, in the laſt <hi>Aeſculapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was chiefly commended, whom the Gréeks ſuppoſed to be the firſt that healed wounds. Afterwards <hi>Hippocrates</hi> born in the Iſle of <hi>Coos,</hi> made a law, that whoſoever recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red health, ſhould write his name in the temple of <hi>Aeſculapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whereby it ſéemeth that <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> was one of the firſt Phiſitians. The firſt phiſitian that ever came to Rome, did come from <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> named <hi>Archagathus,</hi> when <hi>L. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Livius</hi> were Conſuls in Rome: when he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107135:42"/>
came firſt to practiſe phiſick there, he was called for the rare ſight thereof, firſt a butcher, at laſt a murtherer. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat ſeveral hearbs, by ſundry men found out in this art, it were over long. But we will touch on nothing but the firſt inventers and ſearchers of arts, and ſo come unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick which was found, as <hi>Plini</hi> ſaith, by <hi>Zoroaſtes</hi> firſt King of the Bactrians, eight hundred years before <hi>Illion</hi> was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This ſaith <hi>Plini</hi> might have béen better unſought then found for that we ſee every man deſirous to be acquainted with Divels, and to be taught of Simon the ſecret counſels of Divels: inſomuch that women go unto ſchool with <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> or <hi>Calipſo,</hi> to learn ſorcery of them. The Egyptians had great felicity in this art, inſomuch that <hi>Pharao</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the prieſts to ſhew ſome feats before him, deriding <hi>Moſes</hi> and his doings. In preſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> they convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rod into a Dragon, which when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw, to ſuppreſſe vain incantations, and to ſhew how much the one did excel the other, he threw his rod unto the ground, and it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto a Snake, and devoured the Dragon that the Egyptians inchanted. <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe, whom at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God ſo advanced and favoured, made and invented ways to expell Divels. <hi>Eleaſalus</hi> as <hi>Joſephu</hi> doth write, uſed a ceremony in expelling and conjuring of Divels from any man, to put a ring in his noſethrils, having a certain herb, or a root, appointed and named of <hi>Solomon,</hi> within the ring, which root with his ſmel drove out Divels and he conjured them not to return to that man any more. This art in ſhort time grew to that credit, and at this time is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places in ſuch honour, that a conjurer is more eſtéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then a Preacher. There are ſuch branches in this art that do well merit praiſe; for there are divers kinds of theſe Magicks, whereby men ſay they are able to do any thing, and that by it they know all things. The firſt part or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Magick is called Nigromancy, which is a kind of conjuring the dead bodies to tell things to come, as at the wars in Pharſalia betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompeius,</hi> it was foreſhewed by the ghoſt of a dead man unto <hi>Sextus,</hi> the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107135:43"/>
whole chance and event of that war, and how his father <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould loſe his head. The ſecond kind of Magick is called Pyromancy, which is a certain divination by fire, thus <hi>Tanaquil, Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> wife, when ſhe ſaw th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> flames playing about <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> head, ſhe affirmed thereby that he ſhould be King in Rome. The third is Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romancy, which uſeth to prognoſticate things by the air, as by flying of Fowls, and tempeſt of weather as when it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Iron in Lucania, it did preſage ſaid they, the death of <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> amongſt the Parthians, or as <hi>Livi</hi> writeth, when it rained ſtones in Picen at the ſecond wars of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, it was to ſhew the ſlaughter and murther that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> ſhould do in Italy. The fourth is Hydromancy, to judge things to come by fight of water, as <hi>Varro</hi> doth report of a boy, that ſaw the picture or image of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pronouncing and reciting all the wars of <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of Pontus, that ſhould follow in verſes. There are two other kinds of Magick the one named Geomancy, to declare and expound things by the opening gaping, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of earth: the other Chiromancy, to judge by the lines of han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s called Palmiſtry, theſe are they that <hi>Cicero</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of in his firſt book of divinations, where he ſaith, <hi>Cum ſemitam ipſi neſciant alijs tamen, monstrant viam,</hi> they will teach others that way that they know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They will teach others how to have money and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and yet they are themſelves poor beggars, always in the houſe of <hi>Codrus,</hi> hanging at the fléeve of <hi>Irus.</hi> There is again a kind of Soothſaying which was firſt practiſed in the land of Hetruria, where when a certain Husbandman ploughed in the field called <hi>l'arquimen,</hi> a certain man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſight, who ſprang up from the ground which then was plowed named <hi>Tages,</hi> in face and countenance much like a young child: but in wiſedome and diſcretion far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting any ſage Philoſopher. This <hi>Tages</hi> taught all the land of Hetrmia. <hi>Plini</hi> ſaith, that one <hi>Delphos</hi> firſt invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soothſaying, and <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> firſt invented ſoothſaying by fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:107135:43"/>
                  <hi>Polydorus</hi> deſcribeth another ſort of Soothſayers, who were wont to conjecture and foreſhew by beaſts ſlain to be ſacrificed, whether the heart, the liver, or ſuch like did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which when he ſacrificed an Oxe unto <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which had no heart, thereby the Soothſayers prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the infelicity and miſhap of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Likewiſe, King <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his wars againſt the Gréeks, a Mare, being a ſtout and warlike beaſt, brought forth a Hare, a timerous and fearfull thing, whereby they declared the overthrow of <hi>Xerxes</hi> and his huge army, and the flight and cowardize thereof. Again, there is a kind of ſooth ſaying by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thunders and tempeſts. The folly of men was ſuch, that they thought nothing to be in the world, but had hidden knowledge concerning man: they would take nothing in hand without ſome Oracles of <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Apollo;</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed more truſt in flying fowls, in their chirping notes, concerning any attempts which they took in hand, then in their own force and ſtrength; they had more confidence in beaſts of the field, and truſted more in elementary ſights. In fine, there was nothing almoſt, but they had more reſpect either unto the colour, the voice, the proportion, and ſuch like toys, then they had in themſelves, as is before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the worſhipping of their Gods, and inſtitution of Religion. Theſe fooliſh toys were firſt obſerved amongſt the Chaldeans; from Chaldea they came to Gréece, from Gréece to Hetruria, from Hetruria to Rome, and from Rome to all Europe they were ſcattered. Wherefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> that wiſe Hebrew, and the ſingular inſtrument of God for his people, commanded that no man ſhould conſult with thoſe wicked and abominable faculties ſaying unto his people, You ſhall not beléeve Sooth-ſayers, neither ſhal you truſt unto dreams. The Iews were ſo addicted to obſerve theſe augurations, that they would not go to war at any time, without ſome warnings and conjectures had by ſome bird or beaſt; inſomuch, that one <hi>Moſſolanus,</hi> a Iew born, a wiſe man noted in his Countrey, making his voyage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wars, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his firſt book of Antiquitie doth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107135:44"/>
write, was commanded with all his hoſte to ſtay, untill a certaine ſouthſayer would go to counſel and know the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the wars: which then he took in hand, with a bird hard by the army, <hi>Moſſolanus</hi> perceiving how they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and wholly bent to be inſtructed by divination, he took his bow and an arrow, and ſlew this bird, whereat the ſouldiers were ſo amazed, and the ſoothſayer ſo angry, that had not <hi>Moſſolanus</hi> perſwaded the people wiſely he had béen like, though he was their Captain, to have béen by his own ſouldiers ſlain: but after long tumult made, <hi>Moſſolanus</hi> ſpake after this ſort unto his ſouldiers: Do you think that birds, beaſts, and ſuch like dumb things, can foreſhew things to you, which know nothing of themſelves? for behold the bird which you truſted moſt unto, and likewiſe your ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer, could not ſée to avoid my purpoſe when I ſlue him. Do you truſt that creature for your lives which is ignorant of his own death! O blindneſſe of people which yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this age. Thus having briefly paſt the inventers of ſciences, in ſundry countries, men were much given to find other neceſſaries to live by, and ſtudious to make things profitable for their countries, and carefull to augment the ſtate and life of man to full perfection. For the Cyclopians were the firſt workers of Iron work; the Lacedemonians the firſt inventers of harneſſe, ſpears, ſwords, and bucklers for wars: people thereby moſt renowned; the Athenians taught firſt to plant trees and Vineyards; the Phrygians made firſt the chariots and waggons; the Lydians uſed firſt to dreſſe wools, and ſo the people of Caria practiſed firſt bows and arrows, and the Phenicians the Croſſebow; then other particular matters were likewiſe ſought out by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſpeciall men, in ſpeciall countries for the uſe of man, as oyl and honey by <hi>Ariſteus:</hi> Keys by <hi>Theodotus</hi> the Sami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; Ships to ſail by <hi>Jaſon,</hi> ſilver by <hi>Ericthomus,</hi> gold by <hi>Cadmus.</hi> Thus every where each man in his pilgrimage did ſomething worthy of memory. <hi>Thraſon</hi> was renowned for his lofty walls and his towers, <hi>Danaus</hi> for his wells and for his digging of water, <hi>Cinira</hi> for finding out Copper,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107135:44"/>
Braſſe, Lead, and ſuch other metals, <hi>Ceres</hi> for ſowing of Corn, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> for planting the Vine: thus the world in time waxed not onely populous, but it grew alſo skilfull in things, and plentifull of laws, for the redreſſe and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of man.</p>

A ſecond <hi>Iob</hi> in patience, nay hee paſſed <hi>Iob,</hi> for <hi>Iob</hi> knew that his God did ſuffer Satan to puniſh him for love he had to <hi>Iob,</hi> but <hi>Harpalus</hi> perceived that this tyrant did this to him of tyranny and evil will, far from chriſtianity: for in this vale of miſery, we count him wiſe, and certain we may cal him moſt wiſe, that can in proſperity be gentle, and in adverſity be patient. Both theſe examples were ſeen in one man in one day at Rome. <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> having two ſons the hope of Rome, and comfort of the father, the one dead foure dayes before the triumphs of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the other, three dayes after the triumph, returning from Macedonia with that noble victory, and ſuch triumphs unto Rome, that no man could finde in his heart to tell this noble Romane of the heavineſſe in Rome, by reeſon of the death of his children, he perceiving the people of Rome to be ſad, and he ſo merry, they ſo heavy with ſobs and ſighes, and he

ſo glad by reaſon of his triumphs and victories, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe which being at length made known, he then comforted them, that ſhould comfort him ſaying: I thank the Gods more to give me victory over my enemies, to the glory and prayſe of Rome, then I accuſe fortune to ſpoyl me of my children, which by nature were borne to dye: and though much it be to my griefe, yet wiſh I the Gods to do the like to the father as they did the ſons, ſo that the like conqueſt and glory may happen to Rome. In this was both magnanimity and patience. Some men are patient in ſome things, as in a corporal paine: ſome in torments: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is patient of injuries done.

The Lacedemonians were moſt patient in travel, paine, winde, weather, and wars. The people of <hi>Sparta,</hi> at what time cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men of Chios came to pilgrimage, underſtanding the wiſe men of Sparta called Ephori, to be in all things moſt patient, to move them to anger, they vomited before them, and then went where the Ephori ſate in judgement, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it as a common ſtoole to diſcharge nature. When they came to Chios againe they ſaid that the wiſe men of Sparta were fooles and blocks, becauſe they could not move them to be angry, but not more patient then the other were beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

whether ever his mother had been in Rome, he being like to the Emperour in countenance and proportion, meaning thereby that he might be his father if ſhe had been there, the young man perceiving the ſleight of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> anſwered boldly, and ſaid: My mother was never in Rome, but my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath béen divers times in Rome: meaning that the Emperour might rather be his brother that way then he to be his ſon the other way by his mother.

He was went to anſwer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlanderous reproach or tanting words thus gently, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> never weighed ſlanderous words, ſo that he might avoid malicious déeds. We read of the like humanity to be in that moſt worthy Emperour <hi>Trayane,</hi> who when he was blamed by ſome of his friends, for his too much humanity towards his ſubjects, conſidering that familiarity bréedeth contempt, he anſwered.

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:107135:47"/>In the ſame place doth <hi>Bruſonius</hi> joyn unto theſe two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Emperors, a worthy example of like clemency; <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Severus,</hi> who if all Rome had loſt humanity, it had béen found again in him: He in like ſort, being ſpoken unto by one of his Conſuls, and being often reprehended of <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea</hi> his own mother, for his courteſie and facility of ſpéech: I read (ſaid hee) that ſeverity groweth unto tyranny, and tyranny in a Prince worketh his deſtruction. And that lenity is the moſt ſecure ſtate in a Prince, who ſeeth not the experience thereof? Certainly <hi>Nero, Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> were never ſo cruel, as theſe thrée noble Emperors, <hi>Auguſtus, Traiane</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> were gentle and méek. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the great King of Arragon, giving ear a long time to his friends, who found fault with his often pardoning and forgiving thoſe that offended much his own perſon, ſaid, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> had rather ſave many by lenity and gentleneſs, then loſe any by cruelty and tyranny. This King being moved to wars againſt the Venetians and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines, people very ſtout in Italy, and ready from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to march forward to méet his enemies, certain Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors comming from the Florentines to entreat of peace with <hi>Alphonſus</hi> upon humble ſuits and conditions: No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (ſaid <hi>Alphonſus</hi>) ſhall be denied to them that ſéek peace, but frankly and fréely to grant it. His humanity was ſuch, that the Embaſſadors were not ſo ready to aske peace, but he was as ready to grant peace. <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth write that there was a law among the Perſians, that no man ſhould be puniſhed for one fault, but firſt they would examine whether his good deeds were to be rewarded, or his evil life to be puniſhed. <hi>Nicanor</hi> the Macedonian, after he had uſed evil ſpeech every where againſt <hi>Philip, Alexanders</hi> Father, he was complained of unto the king: When the king knew thereof, he anſwered gently, That poverty cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Nicanor</hi> to ſpeak againſt king <hi>Philip:</hi> Therefore he did ſend him money to eaſe his mind, and pardoned withal his offences.</p>

perſwaded by his friends, to revenge theſe backbiters that ſpake ill of him, he anſwered in this ſort; a Prince ought not to bend himſelf to revenge faults, but be ready to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don offences, ſaying moreover: Would God that <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> were able to make his enemies alive again. And to prove that a Prince ought not to revenge. <hi>Adrian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhewed a noble example thereof, he having great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with a certain worthy Roman, and being in great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred towards this man, before he became Emperour, the ſelf ſame day that <hi>Adrian</hi> was made Emperour of Rome, méeting his enemy in the ſtréet, he ſaid aloud to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people. <hi>Evaſiſti</hi> thou haſt won the victory, meaning that he then being a Prince elected, might in no wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the wrongs that he received before.

We read that cruel <hi>Nero</hi> in the beginning of his Empire was ſo gentle, that he wiſhed often he could not read, becauſe he ſhould not put his hand (according unto the cuſtome of Rome) to the libells for the puniſhment of the offendors. And <hi>Domitianus</hi> in the beginning did ſo abhor tyranny and cruelneſſe, that he would forbid to kill any beaſt for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, though they in the latter years forgot this natural clemency? What a noble vertue is humanity in a Prince? what excellency in a noble man? what an ornament in a Gentleman? what commendation in all men, inſomuch that the Snakes of Syria, the Serpents of <hi>Terinthia,</hi> the Scorpions in Arcadia, want no due deſerved praiſe of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> for their gentleneſſe, and ſparing of their natural ſoil, though they were cruel in others. What humanity was it in <hi>Scipio,</hi> having taken captive <hi>Haſdrubal,</hi> king <hi>Maſiniſla</hi> his nigh kinſman, to reſtore him home again without ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? what clemency uſed <hi>Demetrius</hi> to <hi>Silla,</hi> a Captain of K. <hi>Ptolome</hi> even as before, <hi>Ptolome</hi> ſhewed to <hi>Demetrius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being taken priſoner, the like ſhewed he to <hi>Silla?</hi> ſuch

hath béen the lenity of ſome Princes, that thereby they aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented fame, purchaſed great honour, won victories: and ſuch hath béen the tyranny of others, that they have defamed themſelves, won hatred, loſt their eſtates, and in fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed themſelves. For this purpoſe was <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia wont to inſtruct his ſon <hi>Alexander,</hi> to deport him courteouſly towards the Macedonia, to uſe lenity and clemency to his equals, and to ſhew himſelf gentle unto all men, while his father <hi>Philip</hi> yet lived that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that ſeaſon win favour, and find friendſhip with his ſubjects: for then ſome came by heritage, ſome by the ſword, and the moſt came by election. Nothing ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth ſo eſtabliſh the eſtate of a Common-wealth, as the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Prince towards his ſubjects, and the love of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects towards their Prince, the one is never ſéen without the other. King <hi>Darius</hi> therefore underſtanding that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were taxed ſore with Subſedies, blamed his counſel, rebuked their law and made an open oration unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to ſignifie how loth he was to moleſt his ſubjects and that he was as loth to take any from his poor commons, as he knew them to be willing in giving all they had to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their Prince: his care therein ſhewed, and his ſpeech ſo affable, and his good will opened, with ſuch curteſie and lenity, inflamed ſuch benevolence, kindled ſuch a love, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a readineſſe in his ſubjects and made them through gentleneſſe ſo beneficial, that both goods, lands, and lives, were at <hi>Darius</hi> commandement. <hi>Plutarchus</hi> in the life of King <hi>Antigonus</hi> doth recite a famous hiſtory, concerning the alteration and change of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who with tyranny a long while, fomed in bloud, and delighted in murther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given altogether to wickedneſſe of life, ſpoiling at all times every where, ſparing no place at any time; but at length having obtained the kingdome of Macedonia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo méek, ſo liberal, ſo quiet towards his ſubjects, that he was of all men wondred at for his ſudden change, from ſo cruell a tyrant to ſo gentle a Prince, from a ſpoiler of all places, to be a ſparer now of his ſubjects: being demanded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107135:48"/>
the cauſe thereof, anſwered; Then I travelled for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Macedonia, which was to be won with wars and tyranny, and now I labour for the good will of my ſubjects, which is to be gotten with gentleneſs. The onely remedy, the ſure way to win good will of the ſubjects, is always for Princes to be courteous and gentle Pitie in a Prince cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth love in the ſubjects.

The City more ſtout then wiſe, refuſed to open their gates, until with force of Engines the walls were battered down, and the City in the hand of the Emperor to do what it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him. The ſouldiers gréedy of the ſpoil, were by the gentle and mercifull Emperor, charged not to meddle with any within the City, until they had licence. The Emperor being charged by the ſouldiers with his promiſe, to kil and to ſpoil all, and not to leave a dog alive, he kept promiſe like a Prince, and deſtroyed all the dogs of the City, and reſtored the City again to the inhabitants thereof. This noble <hi>Aurelian</hi> had rather his ſouldiers ſhould want, then that they ſhould not ſhew mercy, (according to his cuſtome) to the comfortleſs. <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the great King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> uſed ſuch lenity and gentleneſs towards his brother <hi>Arimenes,</hi> with whom before he was a great enemy, that he made him of a foe, a friend. <hi>Porus,</hi> a famous Prince of India, being conquered by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, fearing that pity might not have place in the heart of ſuch a conqueror, ſought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> (who willed him to ask any thing, and he ſhould have it) but clemency. This vertue long waited upon <hi>Alexander,</hi> till pride (the root of all miſchief) corrupted his gentle heart, and he was by the Medes and Perſians perſwaded to be the ſon of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> So gentle he was before, the King <hi>Darius</hi> did wiſh either to conquer <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> becauſe he might ſhew courteſie unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> or elſe to be conquered by <hi>Alexander.</hi>

                  <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> was wont to uſe the ſaying of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor, that happy are thoſe Princes that foſter up cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in Court, and prudent are thoſe Princes that uſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in their Cities. It was no ſmall proof of humanity in the Senators of Rome, at the burial of <hi>Siphax</hi> King of Numidia, who being taken by the Romans, and kept in <hi>Tiberius</hi> houſe, according to martial law, before he was ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed by the Numidians, died at Rome, where ſuch ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, honour and pomp was ſhewed at his funeral; ſuch gifts given, ſuch liberality uſed, as if <hi>Siphax</hi> had died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his own ſubjects, he might have wanted to have ſuch glorious burial in Numantia, being there their King, as he had in Rome being a priſoner.

Thereby the Romans grew to that admiration with all people that for their lenity, and ſurmounting courteſie, they were of all men beloved; and for their valour and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity they likewiſe were of all the world feared. For as to <hi>Siphax</hi> and <hi>Pruſius,</hi> wonderfull clemency and humanity were by the Romans tendered; ſo was the like to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of Egypt, being of his own brother baniſhed, and by them reſtored again to his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Rome then was called the Haven of ſuccour, the anchor of truſt, the Key of courteſie, whereto all ſuccourleſs Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and noble Captains ſled. Rome flouriſhed then, while

That noble and renowned Phyloſopher <hi>Zeno,</hi> at what time he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a banquet in Athens, to receive the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> King of Macedonia, where certain learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and eloquent Oratours were preſent: after many large and ſubtill diſputations, and great oſtentation of Rhetorick betwixt them had at ſupper, <hi>Zeno</hi> being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Ambaſſadours why he kept ſilence all that while, anſwered, that to keep ſilence is greater knowledge than to ſpeak, for ſilence ſaid <hi>Zeno</hi> is moſt difficult to obtaine, and moſt hard to kéep, and therefore moſt rare to be found. A Gentleman in that company then named <hi>Agatho,</hi> hearing <hi>Zeno</hi> ſo commend ſilence, being no leſſe deſirous to learn ſilence, then having learned it to keep it, prepared a great ſtone and held it in the roofe of his mouth three yeare, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd idle words and ſuperfluous talk and to learn ſober ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and vertuous taciturnity. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when his mother <hi>Olimpias</hi> did ſend letters from Macedonia unto India where then he was at wars, wherein were written much concerning the ſtate of Macedonia, and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made of <hi>Artipater,</hi> with divers more ſecret counſels ſealed: he reading this news, his friend <hi>Aepheſtion,</hi> who knew all the ſecrets of <hi>Alexander,</hi> looking and reading the letters with the King unto the end, <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke his ſignet from his finger after peruſing of thoſe letters, and joyned it cloſe to <hi>Aepheſtions</hi> mouth, ſaying: ſince in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip you fail not in ſilence break not.

How ſure and ſafe is the reward of ſilence, hiſtories of Greek and Latine can well report? Had <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the counſel of his maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> either merrily, or never to ſpeak unto a Prince, he had never found fault with <hi>Alexander,</hi> by ſpeaking to anger <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to harm himſelf.

It may ſéem that ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one way is not ſo beneficial, as it is another way moſt grievous, as is proved by the hiſtory of <hi>Secundus</hi> the Philoſopher, who having company with his own mother in the night time, either of them moſt ignorant of the other, his mother in proceſſe of time having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, for very grief and ſorrow ſlue her ſelf. The Philoſopher likewiſe having underſtood of his mothers death, knowing the cauſe thereof, knew not what to do for that he was aſhamed of the filthy act one way, and moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for the ſudden death of his mother another way: to die, to burn, to hang to drown himſelf, he thought it too ſhort a torment for ſo hainous a fact, and knowing his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a woman, ſtayed not nor feared not to kill her ſelf, to eaſe her ſorrowfull heart, he conceived that he being a Philoſopher, it ſtood him upon to find out the painfulleſt torment in all the world to plague himſelf juſtly for his grievous offence, he therefore vowed unto God never to ſpeak one word ouring life, ſuch torment he thought was moſt painfull unto nature, and thus by ſilence he conſumed away his life. Since therefore ſilence is ſuco a burning diſeaſe, ſo heavy in the heart of man, ſo hard to kéep in, ſo dangerous to utter, how worthy are they of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. how do they merit fame and praiſe that can rule their tongues and keep ſilence?

Yea ſilence was of ſuch dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of ſuch eſtimation, that it poſſeſt place in Princes hearts, that <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> Emperor of Rome, would often ſay, Princes ought not to impart their ſecrets, nor to make any privy to their counſel, conſidering how hard is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to be obſerved. Silence was of ſuch credit, and of ſuch force, that <hi>Metellus,</hi> who uſed to be cloſe in the wars of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, would ſay, that if he knew his own coat to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his ſecrets, he would ſtraight caſt off his coat and burn it. For in him to whom ſecrets of life are revealed, in the ſame alſo is danger of death, for in the committing of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, is life and death alſo committed. Had not that famous <hi>Hercules,</hi> the imp of great <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and off-ſpring of the gods, revealed his counſell and opened his heart unto his wife <hi>Deianira;</hi> Had not that mighty <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſo great in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that he was a Iudge in Iſrael, ſhewed his ſecrets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wife <hi>Dalila,</hi> they had not been conquered by two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom Serpents, Dragons, Lyons yea, all the whole world could not annoy; The juſt puniſhment of Princes for frivolous talking.

I muſt not in this place forget a worthy hiſtory of King <hi>Demetrius, Antigonus</hi> ſon, who being ſent by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Pontus, where <hi>Mithridates</hi> was King being ſworn by his father to keep counſel, of a viſion, that he ſowed gold in Pontus, and that <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſhould reap it: was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded with his army to paſſe unto the Kingdom of Pontus, and without any word to kill <hi>Mithridates.</hi> His ſon <hi>Demetrius</hi> very ſorry, for the great friendſhip which was of late ſprung betwixt <hi>Mithridates</hi> and him, obeying his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went unto Pontus, and commanded his people to ſtay untill he went to know where <hi>Mithridates</hi> was, who when he came in place, he wrote with the end of his ſpear upon the earth in the duſt: <hi>Flee <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
                  </hi> and ſtreight turning to his ſouldiers, he ſpake nothing to him, according to his oath for kéeping ſilence, but wrote a warning to flee; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he kept his fathers counſel one way, and maintained faithfull friendſhip with King <hi>Mithridates</hi> another way.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y on</hi> that wiſe man, would ſay often that age was the Haven of reſt, for that it was the end of miſery, the gate of life, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all pilgrimages. And ſince age is wiſhed of all men, what folly is it to hit any man in the téeth, with that which he chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly deſireth. Wherefore when king <hi>Archelaus</hi> had appointed a great feaſt for his friends, amongſt other diſcoveries then at the table, <hi>Euripides</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the great love which he bare unto <hi>Agathon,</hi> an old tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Poet. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> demanding why ſhould an old man be ſo well eſteemed of <hi>Euripides?</hi> he ſaid Though the ſpring time be pleaſant, yet the harveſt is fertile: though flowers and hearbs grow green in the ſpring, yet wax they ripe in harveſt. The age of man are compared unto the four ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year. his growing time unto the ſpring, his lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty time unto the Summer, his wit time unto the Harveſt, and his old time unto the Winter, which doth make an end of all things. <hi>Frederick</hi> Emperour of Rome, after he had appointed an old man to rule the City of Scadmenna, was often moved, that he for his age was not méet to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern ſuch a City, conſidering the multitude and number of people that were within that City, they thought that a young man ſhould better diſcharge the office: but the wiſe Emperour perceiving how bent and prone were the youth of that town, to have a young man to rule over them, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them after this ſort: I had rather ſaid he, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the governance of the City to one old man, then the governance of ſo many young men unto the City. Better it is that an old man ſhould rule the City, then the City ſhould rule the young men: meaning no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107135:65"/>
otherwiſe then that aged men ſhould onely be admitted to be rulers in Cities, for that there belongeth unto them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of things, and care of youth. Such was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and reverence which was amongſt the young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, toward the Senatours or old men of the City, as both head and leg, did acknowledge the ſame, in doing duty unto age. They had this confidence in age, that no man might be choſen unto the number of the Senatours, before he ſhould be thréeſcore years of age. The like cuſtome had the people of Chalcides, that no man before he were fifty years, ſhould either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear office within their Cities, or be ſent Embaſſadour out of their country. Amongſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, no man could be admitted to be one of the ſage ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, which they called <hi>Magi,</hi> unleſſe perfect age had brought him thereto perforce. Amongſt the Indians, their wiſe men which ruled their country, which were named <hi>Gimnoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtae,</hi> were ancient, for time giveth experience of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Amongſt the Egyptians the like credit was given unto old men, that youth meeting them in the way, would go out of the way to give place unto age, ſo that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours which were called prophets were counted men of much time and experience: even ſo the Babylonians elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſage Chaldeans: the French men, their ancient wiſe men called <hi>Druydes:</hi> In fine, noble Greeks did obſerve the like order in chuſing their rulers and counſellours of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men, as before ſpoken. The Lacedemonian youth, were by the law of <hi>Licurgus</hi> no leſſe charged to reverence age, then their own parents.</p>
               <p>The Arabians in all places without reſpect of perſon, preferred their old men before honour, dignity or fortune. The people called Tarteſi had this law ſo to honour age, that the younger might bear no witneſſe againſt the elder. The reverence ſaid <hi>Chylon,</hi> that ſhould be ſhewed unto age, by young men, ought to be ſuch, that they then being young, doing obedience unto age, they might claim the like when they waxed old of youth. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of Sparta; being an old man, would often go in the cold weather, very thin in a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107135:65"/>
torn cloak, without a coat or doublet, only to ſhew the way unto young men to be hardy in age, by contemning of gay apparell in youth. <hi>Maſiniſta</hi> King of Numidia, being more then threeſcore years of age, would lively and valiantly, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, without cap on head or ſhoe on foot, in the cold or froſty weather in the winter, travell and toyl with the ſouldiers only unto this purpoſe, that young ſouldiers ſhould be hardned thereby in their youth, and practiſe the ſame for the uſe of others, when they came to age them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, <hi>Ihero</hi> King of Sicilia, ſhewed the like example in his old age, being lxxx. years, to train youth and to bring them up ſo in young years, that they might do the like in their old age. For thus judged theſe wiſe Princes, that all men covet to imitate Princes and Kings in their doings. <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> the phyloſopher, and maſter unto <hi>Iſocrates</hi> the Orator, and to divers more nobles of Gréece, thought himſelfe moſt happy, that he being a hundred years and ſeven, was aſwell in his memory as at any time before, and made ſo much of age, that being asked why he ſo delighted in age, he made anſwer becauſe he found nothing in age for which he might accuſe it. So ſayd King <hi>Cyrus</hi> a little before his death being a very old man, that he never felt himſelfe weaker, than when hee was young, The like ſaying is reported of that learned <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who being ſo old, that he was accuſed of his own children of folly, turned unto the Iudges, and ſaid: If I be <hi>Sophocles,</hi> I am not a foole; if I be a foole, I am not <hi>Sophocles;</hi> meaning, that in wiſemen the ſenſes waxed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by uſe and exerciſing the ſame; for we prayſe ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi> the old man that is ſomewhat young, and we commend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the young man that is ſomewhat aged The old is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that hath his wit young and freſh at comandement, and the young is praiſed, that is ſober &amp; ſage in his doings. When <hi>M. Craſſus</hi> a noble Captain of <hi>Rome,</hi> being a very old man took in hand to war againſt the Parthians a ſtrong and ſtout people, being by Embaſſadors warned of his age, and admoniſhed to forſake the wars, he anſwered ſtoutly the Embaſſadour of the Parthians and ſaid: when I come

               <p>What courage was in <hi>Scaevola,</hi> to withſtand that fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of Rome, <hi>Sylla,</hi> who after he had urged the Senators to pron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The like hiſtory we read, that when <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> had by force of arms aſpired unto the office of a Dictator, and came to the Senate houſe, where few Senators were together, the Emperor <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſirous to know the cauſe of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>Confidius,</hi> an aged father of Rome, ſaid, that they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his ſouldiers. Whereat the Emperor mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a while, ſaid. Why did not you likewiſe tarry at home fearing the ſame? Becauſe (ſaid he) age and time taught me neither to fear <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor yet his ſouldiers. For as <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius</hi> ſaith there are young minds in old men; for though <hi>Milo,</hi> the great wreſtler in the games of Olympias, waxed old, &amp; wept in ſpight of his decayed limbs &amp; bruiſed bones, yet he ſaid his mind flouriſhed and was as young as ever it was before. <hi>Solon</hi> hath immortal praiſe in Gréece, for his ſtoutneſs in his age; for when <hi>Piſiſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us</hi> had taken in hand to rule the people of Athens and that it was evident enough that tyranny ſhould procéed thereby; <hi>Solon</hi> in his latter days having great care to his countrey, when that no man durſt refuſe <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> came before his door in Arms, and called the citizens to withſtand <hi>Piſiſtratus;</hi> For age (ſaid he)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107135:66"/>
moveth me to be ſo valiant and ſtout that I had rather loſe my life, then my country ſhould loſe their liberty. What vertue then ſee we to be in age, what wiſedome in time, what courage in old men? The examples of theſe old men ſtir and provoke many to imitate their ſteps, inſomuch that divers wiſhed to be old when they were yet young, to have that honor as age then had. Wherefore king <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, eſpying a young man coloring his hairs gray, ſaid, It behoves thée to put thy wits in color and to alter thy mind.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians, a people that paſt all nations in honouring age made laws in their Cities, that the aged men ſhould be ſo honoured and eſtéemed of the young men, even as the parents were of the children; ſo that when a ſtranger came unto Lacedemonia, and ſaw the obedience of youth towards age, he ſaid: In this country I wiſh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be old, for happy is that man that waxeth old in Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia: and in the great games of Olympia, an old man wanting a place, went up and down to ſit ſome where, but no man received him, but amongſt the Lacedemonians, not onely the young men but alſo the aged gave place unto his gray hairs, and alſo the Embaſſadours of Lacedemonia being there preſent, did reverence him, and took him unto their ſeat, which when he came in, he ſpake aloud: O you Athenians, you know what is good, and what is bad for that which you people of Athens, ſaid he, do profeſſe in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the ſame doth the Lacedemonians put in practice. <hi>Alexander</hi> being in his wars with a great army in Perſia, and meeting an old man in the way in the cold weather, in ragged and rent cloaths, lighted from his horſe, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, mount up into a princes ſaddle, which in Perſia is treaſon for a Perſian to do, but in Macedonia comendable, giving to underſtand how age is honoured, and old men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed in Macedonia, and how of the contrary wealth and pride is foſtred in Perſia: for where men of experience and aged men are ſet nought by, there it cannot be, that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beareth rule. How many in the Empire of Rome, ruled the City, and governed the people, of thoſe that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107135:67"/>
were very aged men? as <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who was thréeſcore years and two in his laſt Conſulſhip: <hi>Valerius Corvinus,</hi> who was ſix times a Conſul in Rome, a very old man, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an hundred and odd years: <hi>Metellus</hi> of like age, called to the like function and adminiſtration in the Common-wealth being an old man. What ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> of <hi>Marcus Perpenna,</hi> of divers other noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, whoſe age and time was the onely occaſion of their advancement unto honour and dignity? What ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite <hi>Arganthonius,</hi> who was threeſcore years before he came unto his Kingdome, and after ruled his Countrey fourſcore years unto his great fame, and great commendations of age? To what end ſhall I repeat <hi>Pollio,</hi> who lived in great credit with the people unto his laſt years, a man of worthy praiſe, of renowned fame, who lived a hundred and thirty years in great authority and dignity? What ſhall I ſpeak of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> whom <hi>Theompus</hi> affirmeth that he lived a hundred and almoſt thréeſcore years in great rule and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Small were it to the purpoſe to make mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of <hi>Dandon</hi> amongſt the Illyrians, which <hi>Valerius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that he was five hundred years before he died, and yet of great memory and noble fame: Or of <hi>Neſtor,</hi> who lived thrée hundred years, of whom <hi>Homer</hi> doth make much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that from his mouth proceeded ſentences ſwéeter then honey; yea, in his latter days almoſt his ſtrength was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the ſame.

               <p>Swéet are the ſayings of old men, perfect are their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſound and ſure their governance. How frail and weak is youth? How many Cities are periſhed by young coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel? How much hurt from time to time have young men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, practiſed, and brought to paſs? And again of age, how full of experience, knowledg and proviſion, painful, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious is it unto the grave? As we read of <hi>Plato</hi> that noble
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107135:67"/>
Philoſopher, who was buſie and carefull for his countrey, writing and making books the very year that he died, being fourſcore and two. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being fourſcore and fourtéen, compiled a book called <hi>Panathenaicus:</hi> of <hi>Gorgias</hi> who being ſtudious and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to profit his countrey, being a hundred and ſeven years, was altogether addicted to his books, and to his ſtudy. So of <hi>Zeno, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> it might be ſpoken, men of no leſſe wit, travell and exerciſe, than of time and age. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith the government and rule of Comon-wealths, conſiſteth not in ſtrength of body, but in the vertue of mind, weighty and grave matters are not governed with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the body, with ſwiftneſſe of the foot, with external qualities but with authority, counſel, and knowledge: for in the one ſaith he there is raſhneſſe and wilfulneſſe, in the other gravity and prudence. As <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> who though not friends at Athens being both rulers, yet age taught them when they were ſent Embaſſadours for the ſtate of Athens, to become friends to profit their country, which youth could never have done. That ſage <hi>Solon</hi> was wont often to brag, how that he dayly by reading, learning, and experience, waxed old. <hi>Apelles</hi> that approved painter and renowned Greek, in his age and laſt time, would have no man to paſſe the day idle without drawing of one line. <hi>Socrates</hi> being an old man, became a ſcholler to learn mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and to play upon inſtruments. <hi>Cicero</hi> being old him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, became a perfect Greek with ſtudy. <hi>Cato</hi> being aged in his laſt years went to ſchool to <hi>Ennius,</hi> to learn the Greek. <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> was almoſt forty years old, before he took a Greek book in hand, and yet proved excellent in the Greek tongue, <hi>Clitomachus</hi> went from Carthage to Athens after forty years of age, to hear <hi>Carneades</hi> the Philoſophers lecture. <hi>Lucius,</hi> as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> doth write, meeting <hi>Marcus</hi> the old Emperor with a book under his arm going to ſchool, demanded of the Emperour whither he went like a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y with his book in his hand: the aged Emperour anſwered, I go to <hi>Sextus</hi> the Philoſopher to learn thoſe things I know
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107135:68"/>
not. O God, ſaid <hi>Lucius,</hi> thou being an old man, goeſt to ſchool now like a boy, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great died at thirty years of age. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of Sicilia, was not aſhamed at fifty years old to learn, and to travel for his knowledge; and leſt he ſhould loſe the uſe of the Latin tongue, he occupied himſelf in tranſlating <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> though he was a King. I do not hold with age in divers men, who for want of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wit, was childiſh again: but of perfect men, in whom age ſeemed rather a warrant of their doings, For even as he that playeth much upon inſtruments, is not to be commended ſo well, as he that playeth cunningly and artificially: ſo all men that live long, are not to be praiſed ſo much as he that liveth well. For as apples being green are yet ſower, untill by time they wax ſweet, ſo young men without warrant of time, and experience of things are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to be miſliked. If faults be in old men, ſaith <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> (as many there be) it is not in age, but in the life and manners of men? Some think age miſerable, becauſe either the body is deprived from pleaſure, or that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth imbecility or weakneſſe, or that it is not far from death, or calleth from due adminiſtration of Common-wealths: theſe four cauſes, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> make age ſeem miſerable and loathſome. What ſhall we ſay then of thoſe that in their old age, have defended their countries, ſaved their Cities, guided the people, and valiantly triumphed over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as <hi>L. Paulus, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> men of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull credit in their old years. What may be ſpoken of <hi>Fabritius, Curius,</hi> and <hi>Cornucanus,</hi> aged men of great agility, of famous memory in their latter days? How can <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> be forgotten, who being both old and blind, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Senatours to compound with King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> for peace, though they all, and the Conſuls of Rome hereunto were much inclined. If I ſhould paſſe from Rome, a place where age was much eſtéemed, unto Athens, amongſt the ſage Philoſophers: if from Athens to Lacedemonia, where age altogether bare ſway and rule: if from thence unto the Ethiopians, and Indians, where all their lives are ruled
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107135:68"/>
and governed by old men: If from thence to any part of the world, I might be long occupied in reciting the honour and eſtéemation of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth write, that the Aethiopians and Indians do live moſt commonly a hundred and thirty years, The people called Epeii in the Countrey of Aetolia, do live two hundred years naturally; and as it is by <hi>Damiates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. <hi>Lictorius,</hi> a man of that Countrey, lived thrée hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. The Kings of Arcadia were wont to live thrée hundred years; the people of Hyperborii lived a thouſand years. We read in the old Teſtament, that <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt father lived nine hundred and thirty years, and <hi>Eve</hi> his wife as many; <hi>Seth</hi> nine hundred and twelve years; <hi>Seth</hi> his ſon called <hi>Enos,</hi> nine hundred and five; <hi>Cainan</hi> the ſon of <hi>Enos,</hi> nine hundred and ten; <hi>Mahalalehel</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cainan,</hi> eight hundred fourſcore and fifteen; ſo <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> lived nine hundred thréeſcore and five years; <hi>Enoch</hi> his ſon, named <hi>Mechuſelah,</hi> lived nine hundred threeſcore and nine years; with divers of the firſt Age, I mean till <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, who began the ſecond world after the floud, who lived as we read, nine hundred and five; his ſon <hi>Sem</hi> ſix hundred years, and ſo lineally from father to ſon as from <hi>Sem</hi> to <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> from <hi>Arphaxad</hi> to <hi>Sala,</hi> from <hi>Sala</hi> to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the leaſt lived above thrée hundred years.

               <p>The Aethiopians are a people that live without Laws and reaſon ſervants and ſlaves to all men, ſelling their children to merchants for corn, their hair long with knots, and curled. The Indians were a people of too much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, the women accompanying them in open ſight: Neither ſowe they, nor build, neither kill they any living beaſt, but féed on barley bread and herbs; they hang at their ears ſmall pearls, and they deck their arms, wriſts and necks with gold: The Kings of India are much honoured, when they come abroad, their ways are ſet and decked with freſh flowers, and men in arms following their Chariots made of <hi>Margarite</hi> ſtones, and men méeting them with frankincenſe: And when their King goeth to bed, their harlots attend him with ſongs and mirth, making their prayers unto their Gods of darkneſſe, for the good ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their King. Again, the children kill their parents when they wax old; the maids and young damoſels of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a are brought abroad amongſt the young men, to chooſe them their husbands: When any man dieth, his wife will dreſs her ſelf moſt braveſt for the funeral, and there they are both buried together. <hi>Hercules</hi> is much honoured in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the River <hi>Ganges.</hi>

               <p>The Scythians are pale and white for the coldneſs of the air, and full of courage: Amongſt theſe people all things are almoſt in common, ſaving no man will have his ſword and his cup common; their wives they weigh not but are common one with another. For drunkenneſs they paſs all nations; for in their ſolemn banquets, there may no man

drink of that appointed cup, which is carried abroad to banquets, unleſſe he had ſlain one or other; for it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongſt the Scythians no honeſty for a man to live unleſſe he had killed one or other. They have no cities nor towns, as Egypt, which was full of them (for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that when <hi>Amazis</hi> reigned a King in Egypt, there were twenty thouſand cities numbred within the countrey of Egypt,) but Scythia is a moſt barren and rude countrey, the people whereof live and féed beaſtly; a countrey moſt cold, for that no wood groweth in the countrey; no religion, no temples for their Gods, but to <hi>Mars</hi> onely: their chief weapons are bows and arrows, When the King dieth in Scythia fifty men, and fifty of his beſt horſes muſt bear him company and be ſlain, for that they judge they ſhall go one way. The Parthians are a people moſt thirſty, ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> for the more they drink, the more thirſty they are, their chief glory they ſéek is by drinking, and are given ſo much to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits and drunkenneſs that their breath for their inordinate drinking doth ſtink, and wax ſo ſtrong, that no man can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide them: their King likewiſe is ſo much honored of them, that when he commeth in place, they ever knéel and kiſſe his foot: He hath many Quéens, with whom the King muſt lie one after another: The King hath about his Chariot ten thouſand ſouldiers, with ſilver ſpears in their hands, and the end of their ſpears all gold; they honour their King, with the Sun, the Moon, the fire, the water, the wind, and the years, to theſe they ſacrifice, and honour them as their Gods; to lie is moſt horrible with the Parthians, inſomuch that they inſtruct their young children onely to avoid lies, and to learn to ſpeak truth, Of all men they hate ungrateful men; they judge it moſt unhoneſt to ſpeak any thing filthy, and loath chiefly that which is ſhamefull, either in talk or in doing inſomuch that they will not ſpit, or make water, but in a place where either a floud, or a river, or ſome other water is; Riding, dancing and tennis they exerciſe moſt.</p>
               <p>The people of Arabia are long haired, with ſhaven heards, ſave that they ſpare the upper lips unſhaven; their

women are common for all men at al times to meddle with leaving a ſtaffe at the door in token unto one another, that ſhe is with one already, and to let underſtand that he muſt tarry untill that man go out, In Arabia, it is not thought amiſſe for any one to lie with his mother, and if any that is not kin, take that in hand, it is adultery: they worſhip as their Gods, <hi>Urania</hi> and <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> They are like unto the Babylonians, people of moſt corrupt life, and moſt given unto filthy pleaſure, Inſomuch that their daughters and their wives are hired unto every man, walking in the ſtréets, going unto the temples, meeting and offering themſelves unto any ſtranger. With the Arabians and Babylonians, we may well compare the Lesbians and the Sybarites, people paſſing in that wickedneſſe, given to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to ſleep and venery, inſomuch that they weary themſelves with all kind of pleaſures, and the exceſſe of their banquets, and the bravery of their women was ſuch that made all the beholders to muſe, and wonder at their exceſſe, as well in cloathing as in féeding, wherein they took glory: they expelled all ſound and noiſe that might trouble their ſleep. So filthy were theſe nations, that hand, foot, head and all parts of the body were naturally given to pollute themſelves with venery.</p>
               <p>The Arcadians are people of ſuch antiquity that (as they ſuppoſe) they are before the Moon, of this they brag moſt: they worſhip <hi>Pan</hi> as their God, this people never trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over their enemies, nor kept wars with any nations, but oftentimes ſerved under other princes, Theſe Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, were like to the people called Averni, for their brags of their antiquity, for even as the Arcadians brag of the moon, ſo the Averni boaſted of their pedigree and ſtock, who were the ancient Troyans, wherefore they would be called brethren unto the ſtout and ancient Romans. The Boetians are the rudeſt people in the world, ſo that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians call them as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, bold baiards and blocks, for their groſſe underſtanding.</p>

The Agrigentines, a people given unto ſuch buildings and banquetting, that <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſo- ſaid: the Agrigentines builded as though they ſhould live for ever, and banquetted as though they ſhould die dayly. The manners of the Aſſyrians were to bring their ſick friends abroad unto the high ways, to ſéek, to ask, and to know remedies for their ſickneſſe of all kind of men that paſſe by: and if by chance without remedy the ſick ſhould die, they ſhould bear him home and bury him ſolemnly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing over the corps with honey and wax. This people did wear for their weapons, daggers and targets, and clubs: they did worſhip Adad for their God, and Adargatin for their Goddeſſe. The people of Creet were moſt expert ſea men, and well practiſed in wars, abſtaining not onely from fleſh but alſo from ſodden meat: their thief infamy was in venery maſculin, otherwiſe for their manners of living, much like unto the noble Lacedemonians, which for their modeſty in feeding and contempt of wealth, for their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſtudy in warfares paſſed all nations, for a token thereof they printed in their Targets, the Gréek letter <hi>L.</hi> named <hi>Lambda;</hi> they brought up their youth, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> that ancient law-ſetter taught them, in all kind of ſtudy, pain, and labour, with hunger, thirſt, cold, and heat, whereby they might be able to ſuffer any chance happened, or injury offered; then were they again brought up in wraſtling, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, running, ſwimming, riding, and ſuch other qualities as might profit their country in time of ſervice, for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was either to win and conquer, or elſe to die and yeeld. Learning and ſcience they little eſteemed, inſomuch that Athens and Sparta could never agree, for that the one was addicted to ſerve <hi>Minerva</hi> or rather the muſes, the other gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto <hi>Mars.</hi>

                  <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made a law in Sparta, that no man might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company with his own wife, but with ſhamefaſtneſſe of that filthy act. The candles might not be lighted in that houſe where the man was, when that he would go unto his wife. When the King would go unto wars, before he ſhould go unto the field to incounter with the enemies, he offered two ſolemn ſacrifices: the one unto <hi>Minerva,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe named <hi>Bellona,</hi> to kindle flames of ſtoutneſſe in his ſouldiers manfully to fight, the other to the Muſes to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their doings in victory as might be commendable and praiſe worthy therein: they paſſed all men in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for as before they brought up their children in ſuch hardineſſe, that their parents would have them whipt, ſcourged, and wounded into the fleſh to harden them in their young years. They ſuffered theft to be unpuniſhed, for that the exerciſe thereof doth repreſent a kind of boldneſſe in wars.</p>
               <p>The nature of the <hi>Lydians</hi> was to delight in ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus divinations, in invention of plaies and in theft. As for the art of dicing, and playing divers kinds of games upon tables the Lydians firſt invented the ſame. They alſo were much enflamed by luxurious life, and filthy venery, which they neither ſpared day nor night. <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Nation called <hi>Eſteni,</hi> which abſtained from all kind of pleaſure, inſomuch, that they never accompany with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, never eat fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor drink wine; and thus by cuſtome of faſting they became naturally chaſt: For cuſtome and uſe (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) is another nature. In that countrey no man poſſeſſeth any thing of his own, all things are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent betwéen them, and they live as companions one with another; for in theſe their vertues they excel all men in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and moſt ardent love towards God. Thus vertue moſt diligent with great care and ſtudy was weighed, their Neighbours wonderfully beloved and made of, ſo that by this their precept of life, they have great fame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations. They have few Cities, and as few Towns, and for that they take the earth as a common Mother, they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107135:72"/>
have all one reſpect unto all kind of men. The Getes have no diviſion of lands, no limits of ground, nor any partitions of their goods: they drink bloud mingled with milk, they eat no fleſh, and they rejoyce much when their friends die, even as the people called Trauſes in Thracia do, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is born into the world, they mourn and lament with wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eys, that the little child then born, ſhould know the miſery and ſtate of this wretched world: and when any of their friends are dead, they rejoice and be glad with melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and all kind of mirth, for that he hath paſt this toiling life. The Thracians, people of great antiquity, were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous warriours, bragging much that <hi>Mars</hi> the God of war was born in their country, much addicted unto drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſelling their children in the market, and their maids and daughters are common to lie with every man: they judge and count it moſt commendation to live onely by ſpoil, theft and wars, they brag if any have a wound, and think it a fame unto the perſon. And of the contrary, if they have no mark in the forehead, no wound in the body, they will judge thoſe idle men and cowards; the common people worſhip <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> for their Gods: their king onely doth worſhip <hi>Mercury,</hi> by whom the King uſeth to ſwear.</p>

Why ſhould I ſpeak of the Maſſagetes, of the people Naſomones? I will (according to promiſe) omit the prolixity therof, touching all countreys by the way, or ſome of the chief; as of Egypt with brags and vaunts of their antiquity: Of the Ethiopians and the people of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, with their ſimplicity and ſlavery; ſo the Carthaginians were falſe and deceitfull: the Babylonians wicked and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: the Perſians drunkards and gluttons: the Syci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians wary and truſty: ſo was the cruelneſſe of the Caſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: the filthineſſe of the Lesbians: the drunkenneſſe of the Scythians: the fornication of the Corinthians: the rudeneſſe of the Boetians: the ignorance of the Cymmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: the beaſtlineſſe of the Sibarites: the hardineſſe of the Lacedemonians: the delicacy of the Athenians, and the pride and glory of the Romans.

But becauſe in this place it were ſomewhat to the purpoſe, to declare the glory and ſtate of Rome, which of all the world was eſtéemed and feared, and for that Rome had more enemies then all the whole world beſide, to ſhew briefly how they flouriſhed how their fame ſpread, and their glory grew. I think it not expedient to meddle with the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107135:74"/>
antiquity thereof in the time of <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Cameſes,</hi> but to touch upon their fame by managing of wars, in the time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> who being begotten of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Rhea</hi> a Veſtal virgin, was the firſt builder of the city, and alſo king there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of This King <hi>Romulus</hi> warred on the Sabins after he had elected a hundred Senatours, to diſcern and judge the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the City, to defend Iuſtice, and practice the ſame, and to puniſh vice and wrongs, according to the law of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who willed every Common-wealth to be governed with reward unto the vertuous, and puniſhment to the vicious. Again, he appointed certain ſouldiers, unto the number of one M. to be in a readineſſe alwaies to defend the City. After <hi>Romulus</hi> ſuccéeded <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the ſecond king, a man very religious and pittiful: he in his time made laws to obſerve rites, ſacrifices, and ceremonies, to worſhip their Gods: he made Biſhops and Prieſts, he appointed the Veſtal virgins, and all that belong thereto. Thirdly came <hi>Tulius Hoſtillius</hi> to be king in Rome, whoſe felicity was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teach the youth of Rome the diſcipline of warfare, and ſtirred them wonderfully to exerciſe and practice the ſame. Then fourthly ſucceeded <hi>An.

Then <hi>Collatinus</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> after theſe Kings were exiled in reward of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring liberty and for honeſt life, were the firſt Conſuls in Rome: they I ſay altered the government of the City, from a Monarchy to a kind of government called <hi>Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> which continued in Rome from the time of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus,</hi> untill the time of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Quin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> Of the ſtrange Natures of Waters, Earth, and Fire.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N divers learned Hiſtories we read, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Pliny</hi> of the wonders of waters, and of the ſecret and unknown nature of fire, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the rare ſight thereof, are noted things to be marvelled at. There is a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the countrey of Campania where if any mankind will enter therein, it is written that he ſhall incontinent be bereft of his ſenſes. And if any woman kind happen to go into that water, ſhe ſhall always after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be barren. In the ſame countrey of Campania, there
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107135:75"/>
is a lake called Avernus, where all flying fowls of the air that fly over that lake, fall preſently therein and die. A well there is in Caria, called Salmacis, whoſe water if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man drink thereof, he becommeth chaft, and never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the company of a woman. The River <hi>Maeander</hi> doth bréed ſuch a kind of ſtone, that being put cloſe to a mans heart, it doth ſtraight make him mad.</p>
               <p>There are two rivers in Boetia, the one named Melas, whoſe water cauſeth ſtraight any beaſt that drinketh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if it be white, to alter colour to black; the other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſus, which doth change the black beaſt to a white beaſt by drinking of the water. Again, there is in India a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, where nothing may ſwim, beaſt, bird, man, or any living creature, but they all ſink; this water is called Silia. In Affrica on the contrary part, there is the water named Apuſtidamus, where nothing, be it never ſo heavy or unapt to ſwim, but will ſwim upon the water; Lead, or any heavy mettal doth ſwim in that lake, as it is in the well of Phinitia in Sicilia. Infinite waters ſhould I recite, if I in this would be tedious, in repeating their names, whoſe ſtrange natures, whoſe ſecret and hidden operation, whoſe force and vertue were ſuch as healed divers diſeaſes: As in the Iſle of Avaria, there was a water that healed the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and the ſtone. By Rome there was alſo a water called Albula, that healed gréen wounds. In Cilicia the river called Cydnus was a preſent remedy to any ſwelling of the legs. Not far from Neapolis there was a well, whoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter healed any ſickneſſe of the eys. The lake Amphion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all ſcurfs and ſores from the body of any man. What ſhould I declare the natures of the four famous Rivers that iſſue out of Paradiſe; the one is named Euphrates, which the Babylonians and Meſopotamians have juſt occaſion to commend; the ſecond is called Ganges, which the Indians have great cauſe to praiſe; the third called Nilus, which the countrey of Egypt can beſt ſpeak of; and the fourth is called Tigris, which the Aſſyrians have moſt commodity by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:107135:75"/>Here might I be long occupied, if I ſhould orderly but touch the natures of all waters. So the alteration of the ſeas, and the wonders thereof appear, as ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſaltneſſe and ſwéetneſſe, and all things incident by nature to the ſeas, which were it not that men ſee it dayly, and obſerve the ſame hourly, and mark things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, more wonders would appear by the ſeas, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reaſon might be alledged for. God (as the Prophet ſaith) is wonderfull in all his works. So the five golden Rivers which learned and ancient writers affirm, that the ſands thereof are all gliſtering gems of gold, as Tagus in Spain Permus in Lydia, Pactolus in Aſia, Idaſpes in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, and Arimaſpus in Scythia: Theſe are no leſſe famous through their golden ſands, which their rowling waves bring to land in theſe aforeſaid countreys, then Parneſſus in Boetia, where the Muſes long were honoured, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois in Phrygia, where <hi>Venus</hi> was conceived by <hi>Anchiſes.</hi> To coequat the number of theſe five laſt and pleaſant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, there are five as horrible to Nature; as Styx in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia, whoſe property is to kill any that will touch it, and therefore feigned of the Poets to be conſecrated to <hi>Pluto,</hi> for thfre is nothing ſo hard but this water wil conſume, ſo cold is the water thereof: Again, the River Phlegeton is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, for the one is not ſo cold, but the other is as hot, and therefore called <hi>Phlegeton,</hi> which is in Engliſh, Fiery or ſmoakie, for the Poets feign likewiſe, that it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out in flames of fire: Lethes, and Acheron, two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the one in Affrica, the other in Epire, the one called the river of forgetfulneſſe, the other the river of ſadneſſe: The fifth called Cocytus, a place where mourning never ceaſeth. Theſe five rivers for their horror and terror that procéeded from them, for the ſtrange and wonderfull effects thereof, are called infernal lakes, conſecrated and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King <hi>Pluto,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> at large deſcribeth. Divers wells, for the ſtrangeneſſe of the waters, and for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe thereof, were ſacrificed to the Gods as Ciſſuſa, a well where the Nurſes of <hi>Bacchus</hi> uſed to waſh him, was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107135:76"/>
therefore conſecrated to <hi>Bacchus;</hi> ſo Melas to <hi>Pallas,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganippe to the Muſes, and ſo forth, not moleſting the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further with natures of Water, I mean now briefly to touch the ſtrange nature of the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth, that there was never man ſick in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris, nor in Croton, neither any Earthquake ever heard in Licia. By Rome, in the field called <hi>Gabienſis,</hi> a certain plat of ground, almoſt two hundred Acres, would tremble and quake as men rode upon it. There are two hils of ſtrange natures by the River called Indus, the nature of the one is to draw any Iron to it, inſomuch, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that if nails be in any ſhoes, the ground of that place draweth the ſole off, There is a piece of ground in the City Characena, in the countrey of Taurica, where if any come wounded, he ſhall be ſtraight healed: And if any enter under divers places, as in a place called Hirpinis, where the temple of <hi>Mephis</hi> is builded; or in Aſia, by Iheropolis, they ſhall inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently die. Again, there are places by the vertue of ground in that place, that men may propheſie. Divers times we read that one piece of ground devoured another, as the hill Ciborus, and the city hard by, called Curites, were choaked up of the earth. Phegium a great mountain in Aethiopia, and Sipilis, a high hill in Magneſia, with the cities named Tantalis and Galarus.</p>
               <p>There is a great Rock by the City Harpaſa in Aſia, which may be moved eaſily with one finger, and yet if a man put all his ſtrength thereunto, it will not ſtir. I néed not ſpeak of mount Aetna in Sicilia, of Lypara in Acolia, of <hi>Chymera</hi> in Lycia, of Veſuvius and Aenocauma, five fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery mountains, which day and night burn ſo terribly, that the flame thereof never reſteth. If any man will ſee more of theſe marvellous and wonderfull effects of Elements, let him read the ſecond book of <hi>Plini,</hi> where he ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the like examples. There he ſhall ſee that in ſome places it never rained, as in Paphos upon the temple of <hi>Venus;</hi> in Nea, a town in Phrygia, upon the temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and in divers places elſe, which is the nature of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107135:76"/>
the ground. About Babylon a field burneth day and night. In <hi>Aethiopia</hi> certain fields about mount <hi>Heſperius,</hi> ſhine all night like ſtars.</p>
               <p>As for Earthquakes and wonders that thereby happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I will not ſpeak but thoſe ſtrange grounds that never alter from ſuch effects before mentioned, beſide the mettals, the ſtones, the herbs, the trées, and all other things are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and ſtrange, as <hi>Pliny</hi> in divers places doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And as for fire it is too great a wonder that the whole world is not burned thereby, ſith the Sun, the Stars, the Elementary fire, excell all miracles, if God had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in kéeping the ſame from damage, and hurt to man: yea, appointed that the heat of the Sun ſhould not kindle ſtraws, ſtubbles, trées, and ſuch like, where the heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as we daily ſée) burneth ſtones, lead, and harder ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſith eſpecially that fire is in all places, and is able to kindle all things, inſomuch, that the water Thraſimenos burneth out in flames, which is unnatural and ſtrange that fire kindles in water; and likewiſe in Egnatia a City of Salentine, there is a ſtone, which if any wood touch, it wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the Well called <hi>Nympheus,</hi> there is a ſtone likewiſe whence come flames of fire, the ſtone it ſelf burneth in the water. A greater wonder it is, that the fire ſhould be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by water, and extinguiſhed by wind. Fire flaſhed about the head of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> being then a boy in ſleep, which did prognoſticate that he ſhould be King of the Romans. Fire ſhined about the head of <hi>L. Marcius</hi> in Spain, when he encouraged his ſouldiers to revenge manfully the deaths of thoſe noble and famous Romans, named <hi>Sipians.</hi> The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effects of fire are moſt wonderful and moſt ſtrange.</p>

                  <p> Of the World, and of the ſoul of Man, with divers and ſundry opinions of the Philoſophers about the fame.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt divers Philoſophers and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, grew a great controverſie of the beginning of the world, ſome of the beſt affirming that it had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor can have end, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> applying incorruption, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual revolution to the ſame. Some with <hi>Epicurus</hi> thought the world ſhould be conſumed: Of this opinion was <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius.</hi> Some on the other ſide did judge with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that ſo much of the world ſhould be deſtroyed as was of his own nature. <hi>Thales</hi> ſaid there was but one world, agréeing with <hi>Empedocles. Democritus</hi> affirmeth infinite worlds, and <hi>Metrodorus</hi> the Philoſopher conceived worlds to be innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. Thus hold they ſeveral opinions concerning the making, the beginning, the ending, and the numbers of the world. What child is there of this age, but ſmileth at their folly, reaſoning largely one againſt another, in applying the cauſe and the effect of things to their own inventions? And as they have judged diverſly of the world, concerning the frame and nature thereof; ſo were they as far off from the true underſtanding of the Creation of man. Some groſly thought, that mankind had no beginning. Some judged that it had a beginning by the ſuperiour bodies: And for the antiquity of mankind, ſome judge Egypt to be the firſt people, ſome Scythia, ſome Thrace, ſome this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſome that countrey, with ſuch phantaſtical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as may well appear to the moſt ignorant an error. And alas, how ſimple are they in finding out the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſoul, what it ſhould be, where it ſhould be, and by what it ſhould be? Some ſay that there is no ſoul, but a natural moving, as <hi>Crates</hi> the Theban: Some judge
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107135:77"/>
the ſoul to be nothing elſe but fire or heat, betwéen the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible parts: others thought it an air received into the mouth, tempered in the heart, boiled in the lights, and diſperſed through the body. Of this opinion was <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> and alſo <hi>Anaximenes. Hippias</hi> judged the ſoul of man to be water. <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> affirmed it to be earth, <hi>Empedocles</hi> is of opinion that it is hot bloud about the heart ſo that they vary in ſundry opinions, attributing the cauſe thereof either to the fire, or elſe to water, either to the earth, or to the air, and ſome unto the complexion of the four ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: others of the earth and fire: others of water and fire: ſome again reaſon that the ſubſtance of the ſoul is of fire and of the air. And thus of approved Philoſophers, they ſhow themſelves ſimple innocents.</p>
               <p>How ignorant were they in defining the ſoul of man? So far diſagréeing one with another, that <hi>Zenocrates</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth again the ſoul to be but a number that moves it ſelf, which all the Egyptians conſented to. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf the Prince of all Philoſophers, and his maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> ſhewed in this their ſhifting reaſon, which both agree that the ſoul is a ſubſtance which moveth it ſelf. Some ſo rude and ſo far from perfection in this point, that they thought the heart to be the ſoul: ſome the brain. How ridiculous and fooliſh ſéemeth their aſſertion to this age concerning the ſoul, and as childiſhly they diſpute and reaſon again about the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the ſame, where and in what place of the body the ſoul reſteth. For <hi>Democritus</hi> judgeth his ſeat to be in the head: <hi>Parmenides</hi> in the breaſt: <hi>Herophilus</hi> in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the brain: <hi>Strato</hi> doth think that the ſoul was in the ſpace between the eye brow: yea ſome were ſo fooliſh, to judge it to be in the ear, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of Perſia did: <hi>Epicurus</hi> in all the breaſt: <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſuppoſed it to be in a hollow vein of the heart: <hi>Empedocles</hi> in the bloud: <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle</hi> and others that were the beſt and trueſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, judged the ſoul to be indifferent in all parts of the body? ſome of the wiſeſt ſuppoſed, that every peece and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now after I have opened their ſeveral opinions concerning what the ſoul is, and where the ſoul is, you ſhall here likewiſe hear, whither the ſoul ſhall go after death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Philoſophers which as diverſly vary and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrée in this, as you before heard the diverſity of opinions concerning the ſubſtance, and the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And firſt to begin with <hi>Democritus,</hi> who judgeth the ſoul to be mortal, and that it ſhall periſh with the body: to this agrée <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Pliny. Pythagoras</hi> judged that the ſoul is immortal, and when the body dieth it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>éeth to his kind. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſome parts of the ſoul which have corporal ſeats, muſt dye with the body, but that the underſtanding of the ſoul, which is no inſtrument of the body, is perpetual. Tho people called Drinda were of this judgement, that ſouls ſhould not deſcend to hell, but ſhould paſs to another world; as the Philoſophers called Eſſei, which ſuppoſe that the ſouls of the dead do live in great felicity beyond the Ocean Seas. The Egyptians judged with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that the ſouls of men ſhould paſs from one place to another, and then to enter into another man again. The Stoicks are of that opinion, that the ſoul forſaketh the body in ſuch ſort, that the ſoul which is diſeaſed in this life, and advanced by no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, dyeth together with the body; but they judge it, if it be adorned with noble and heroical vertues, that it is then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with everlaſting natures. Divers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans hold that the ſoul is immortal, but yet they ſuppoſe that reaſonable ſouls enter into unreaſonable bodies, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plants or trées for a certain ſpace.</p>
               <p>There were again ſome frivolous Philoſophers, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> which ſay, that men firſt grew out of the earth in manner of herbs, like to the fables of Poets, who fain that men grew of the ſowen téeth of Serpents.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107135:78"/>
Some again very childiſhly affirm, that there be nine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées of puniſhment, or rather nine manſions in Hell, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and prepared for the ſoul. The firſt ſeat is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for young infants; the ſecond for Idiots and fools (I fear that place will be well filled;) the third for them that kill themſelves; the fourth for them that be tormented with love; the fifth for thoſe that were found guilty before Iudges; the ſixth appointed for ſtrong men and champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the ſeventh is a place where the ſouls be purged; the eight ſeat is where the ſouls being purged do reſt; the ninth and laſt is the pleaſant field <hi>Eliſium.</hi> And to joyn theſe Legends of Lies of old women, with frivolous fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Poets, they likewiſe affirm the like folly of fiery Phlogeton, of froſty Cocytus, of the water of Styx, of the ſloud Lethes, and of Acheron, with other ſuch whence all Paganical rites, and fond fooliſh obſervations firſt grew I mean of fables of Poets, and not by the reading of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. O blind baiards in ſéeking that which they could never find! And as they could prove and ſay that the body came out of the earth the moyſture out of the water, the breath of man by the air, and the heat of man by the fire; ſo could they not know the worker thereof, how wit and wiſedome came from God, how all things were made by him of nothing. This knew they not, not that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed learning, but that they wanted the knowledge of true Divinity.

They could likewiſe appoint ſeats for the bodies ſuperior in man, as the Ram in the head the Bull in the neck, and the Crab, in the broſt the Lion in the heart, and the Fiſh in the foot, and ſo others; but they could in no wiſe find a ſeat for the ſoul, Truly is it ſaid, that God revealeth wiſedome unto Babes, and hideth the ſame from the Sages of the world.

The Romans did celebrate in the beginning of the ſpring, ſuch feaſts and ſacrifices to <hi>Berecynthia,</hi> called the Mother of the Gods, that every man did offer of the chiefeſt things that he did poſſeſs to pleaſure this Goddeſs. There were divers other kinds of ſacrifices, and vain ſuperſtitious ceremonies obſerved then in Rome, whoſe beginnings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded from the invention of Devils, which of long time were honoured as Gods; for then men ſought no help but of their Gods, which were rather Devils: As <hi>Polidorus</hi> in his fourth Book affirmeth of a certain rich man in Rome, who had thrée of his ſons ſore ſick of the plague; this man was named <hi>Valeſius,</hi> who every night at home in his houſe beſought his houſhould Gods called <hi>Penates,</hi> to ſave his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to plague him for the fault of his ſons: Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night praying to his Gods, for the health of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a voice was heard, that if he would go with his thrée ſons to Tarentum, and waſh his ſons with the water which was conſecrated to <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> they ſhould recover their health. <hi>Valeſius</hi> thought the way was far, yet for health to his children, he took his journey; and being ready ſhipt in <hi>Martius</hi> field, hard by the river Tyber, he was deſired of the maſter of the ſhip, to go to the next village called Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, for a little fire, for the fire was out in the ſhip, and the mariners buſie about other things: When <hi>Valeſius</hi> heard the name of Tarentum, he knew ſtraight that it was that place that his Gods appointed him to go to, for the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Tarentum was in the furtheſt part of all Italy, in

the country of Calabria, he willingly went and brought both fire with him for the Maſter of the Ship, and water for the children, which being given to his ſons, they recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red health. Wherefore in memory of this, he recompenſed his Gods with this ſacrifice: he in the night appointed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn playes to honour <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> to each ſeverall nights every year for ſo many ſons as he had that recovered health, erecting up altars, and offering ſacrifices in honour and ſolemnity of <hi>Pluto.</hi> Theſe were the Oracles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine anſwers which the Divels were wont to give in Idols to deceive men withal, theſe I ſay were they that allured the people to idolatry.</p>

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that the chiefeſt Prieſts of Rome the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, for that the ſacrifices and feaſts, the ceremonies and rites belonging to new made Gods, grew to ſuch a number that they appointed thrée men called <hi>Triumviri,</hi> to be rulers of the ſacrifices, and appointed other thrée that ſhould kéep the ſacred Oracles of <hi>Sybilla,</hi> The Oracles of <hi>Sybilla</hi> were written in books, to which they reſorted oftentimes for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and admonition, fiftéen men were appointed to know what was to be done in any peril or neceſſity: as at the wars betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſuch prodigious ſights were ſéen, ſuch unnatural working of the heavens, ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſights on the earth, ſuch portentuous miracles then ſeen in Rome, that the Senators came to <hi>Sybilla</hi> to know the effects and ends of theſe monſtrous ſhows, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of the ſtate of the City; Vnto whom ſhe gave ſix letters in writing, three of R. and three of F. to be expon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their wiſemen, whereof the meaning was found the thrée of R. were theſe, <hi>Reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Dioniſius</hi> in his fourth book ſaith, that an aged woman brought nine books to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> being the ſeventh and laſt King of the Romans, which ſhe would have ſold for three hundred Crowns to the King, letting <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius</hi>

underſtand, that thoſe books were full of Oracles and divine anſwers; but he making a jeſt of her books, did burn three of them before her face, demanding of her again, what he ſhould pay for the other ſix? ſhe anſwered, Thrée hundred Crowns: then he burned thrée more, and asked what he ſhould pay for the thrée books that were left? She anſwered as before, Thrée hundred Crowns: The King marvelling much at the conſtancy of the woman bought the three books for three hundred Crowns, and after that time; that woman was never ſeen in Rome, wherefore it is thought of the Romans, that ſhe was <hi>Sibilla.</hi> Therefore theſe three books were preſerved in Rome as aforeſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cuſtody of three men appointed for the purpoſe, and ſhe ſo honoured and worſhipped, that ſacrifice upon ſacrifice was offered to <hi>Sibilla</hi> in Rome. Thus the Oracles of <hi>Sibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> in Rome; the Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> in Delphos; the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Ammon, were the inſtructors to the Gentiles, and teachers of the Greeks. Moreover they had ſuch ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of feaſts, and celebration of banquets, either called pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical feaſts, for that it was ordained by Prieſts; or elſe triumphant banquets after victories, made of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and given to the people; or elſe funeral feaſts, where honour and ſolemnitie was had for the dead.</p>
               <p>As for games and plays to ſacrifice and to honour their Gods, they had <hi>Lupercalia, Floralia, Bacchanalia, Cerealia,</hi> with divers and ſundry others to pleaſure their Gods, and to mitigate their fury and wrath. For in the days of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius</hi> the proud, for that divers women of Rome being great with children, got ſufeits in eating of Bulls fleſh, they appointed certain ſacrifices to the Gods infernals, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the banquets and feeſts, the mirth and melody, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime and ſport the great games and plays that alwayes Greeks and Gentiles have uſed towards their Gods, were almoſt infinite. The honour and reverence that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had in Creet, the worſhip and fame that <hi>Apollo</hi> had in Delphos, the ſacrifices and ceremonies that <hi>Mars</hi> had in Thracia, are in books written, and by authority recorded, and I fear they be in the hearts of men too deeply printed. <hi>Pallas</hi> had her ſeat in Athens, <hi>Juno</hi> was enſhrined in Samos, <hi>Diana</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, <hi>Cibeles</hi> in Phrigia, <hi>Venus</hi> in Ciprus, <hi>Ceres</hi> in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia: Again, <hi>Pan</hi> was in reverence amongſt the Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Oſiris</hi> amongſt the Egyptians, <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the Iſle of Naxus, <hi>Vulcan</hi> in Lemnos. In fine, blocks and ſtones, dogs and cats, oxen and calves were honoured and worſhipped as Gods. Thus they wandred in this vale of miſery like pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims far from the countrey that we ought to travel to, where that true and living God is, the God of ſalvation and health, which is without end to be worſhipped. He is the God of all men, and yet of the feweſt worſhipped; he is the Saviour, and yet he is neglected; yea and more rejected of us that be Chriſtians, then the blocks and ſtones that were honored of the Gentiles. And for proof hereof I mean to ſhew the ſevere laws that were both in Athens and Rome, the two lights of the world, for obſerving of their Gods and Religion: Neither the Philoſophers in Athens, nor the Senators in Rome nor the Magiſtrates and Princes of the world then would in any wiſe permit injuries towards the Gods, or ſuffer any evil report toward their religion, in ſuch care were they leſt they ſhould offend their Gods, and break their laws, Certain husbandmen found in the lands of <hi>L.

For the old and ancient men would have nothing kept within their city that might hinder their Gods: For before all things they preferred their Gods, and their religions, and ſo honoured their Prieſts, their ſacrifices, and their veſtal Virgins, more then they honoured the Emperours and Senators, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by a Hiſtory in <hi>Valerius,</hi> that when Rome was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and conquered by the Gauls, and the veſtal Virgins were enforced to bear thoſe things away, ſhifting more for the ſacrifices and rites of their religion, in carrying their books, their garments, and their Gods, then they cared for their countrey, friends, children, and goods: Inſomuch that <hi>L.

               <p>In the ſelf ſame time and troubles of Rome, when the Capitol was beſieged with the enemies, <hi>Caius Fabius</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how religion was then eſtéemed, girded himſelf like a ſacrificer, and carryed in his hand an hoſt to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was ſuffered to paſſe through the middeſt of his enemies to mount Quirinal, where ſolemnities and ſacrifices were done to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, he likewiſe went to the Capitol through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Army with all his company, and by this means got the victory over his enemtas, more by religion then by ſtrength.</p>
               <p>So much was ſuperſtition and idolatry honoured and obſerved every where, that the Perſians ſailed with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhips to do ſacrifice and ſolemnity to <hi>Apollo</hi> at Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.

The wrath of <hi>Juno</hi> was the cauſe of the unhappy ſucceſſe of that noble Conſul <hi>Varro</hi> in the wars of Canna. <hi>Hercules</hi> forgot not to revenge the contempt and deſpiſing of his ceremonies and rites by <hi>Pontius,</hi> which once he and his name received as their God but being by <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> perſwaded, who then was Cenſor in Rome, to neglect he was deſtroyed, he and all his name, which were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber above thirty, and <hi>Appius</hi> for his counſel was made blind.</p>
               <p>Thus the Gentiles and Heathens thought that nothing could eſcape unrevenged of their Gods. This made <hi>Maſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa</hi> King of Numidia to ſend back the Ivory téeth that the Maſter of his Ships brought from the Temple of <hi>Juno</hi> in Meleta unto Meleta again. This made the Senatours of Rome, to ſend back again the money which <hi>Pleminius</hi> the meſſenger of <hi>Scipio</hi> took away from the temple of <hi>Proſerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> again, fearing the anger and diſpleaſure of the Goddeſſe. Thus were the people blinded with vain ceremonies of the Prieſts, Biſhops, and Magiſtrates. Thus were the rude people deceived by diſſimulations of the Potentates, as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> one of the firſt Idolaters that was in Rome, would make the people beléeve that he had warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and admonitions from the Nymph <hi>Aegeria,</hi> to whom he ſaid he had acceſſe in the night time to be inſtructed in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107135:84"/>
the ceremonies of Rome. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the law-giver amongſt the Lacedemonians perſwaded the people that what law ſoever he made, it was done by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo. Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> made the Locreſians believe that his doings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings were done by the counſel of <hi>Minerva. Piſiſtratus</hi> deceived the people of Athens through diſſimulations by a woman named <hi>Phia,</hi> whom hee dreſſed like <hi>Pallas:</hi> he was brought often times by this woman into the Caſtle of <hi>Pallas:</hi> and the rude people thought that ſhe was <hi>Pallas</hi> her ſelf, and judged thereby that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> might do what he would, and have what he craved of <hi>Pallas. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> King of Créet, was wont every ninth year to go unto a ſecret place by himſelf, and there ſtaying to conſult with <hi>Jupiter</hi> what law he ſhould make to the people of Creet, as he informed the people, and ſo deceived them craftily. Thus we ſee how <hi>Licurgus</hi> amongſt the Lacedemonians, <hi>Zaleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> amongſt the Locreſians, <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> amongſt the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>Numa</hi> amongſt the Romans, and <hi>Minos</hi> in Créet have deceived the ignorant people with counterfeit talking with Gods, making them to beléeve that the Gods counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them. Thus by craft they invented falſe Gods, framed ceremonies, and obſerved vain orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sertorius</hi> that famous Sabin, and ruler long in Rome, was wont upon the high rocks of Luſitania to conſult with a white Hart, of whom he was warned to avoid things, and to do things, to take things, and to refuſe things: inſomuch, that to blind the people, he would attempt nothing till he had conſulted on the Rock with this white Hart. <hi>L. Sylla</hi> when at any time he went unto wars, would in open ſight of the ſouldiers imbrace a certain remembrance, a ſign which he brought from Delphos with him to Italy, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that to kéep promiſe as <hi>Apollo</hi> had commanded him. <hi>Scipio</hi> would never take any publick affairs in hand, before he had gone to the Capitol to the ſecret Alter of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and there continued a while to deceive the people. Thus were they thought to be the Of-ſprings of Gods by the common ſouldiers, whom they deceived with falſe ſhews, and to this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107135:84"/>
effect that the people ſhould flatter and obey them in all things.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Liberius</hi> did uſe to féed <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> with flattery ſaying that mortal men ought to deny nothing unto thoſe to whom the Gods do grant all things; ſo did theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Princes hunt for ſuch honour as <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> had. <hi>Mahomet</hi> a great Prophet, and a mighty God amongſt the Gentiles, whoſe laws till this day the moſt part of the world obſerve, had ſuch a beginning as aforeſaid, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the people, that a Dove that he taught to come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day upon his ſhoulders, to féed on certain grains of wheat, which he alwaies did bear in his ears, was the holy Ghoſt, and perſwaded the people that his doings and laws were appointed by the holy Ghoſt, which dayly came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, and to make orders amongſt the people. We read in divers places of the ſcriptures, that the men of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da did build altars and make Idols upon every high hill, and under boughs of trées. The Idolatry of the people of Iſrael, with the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> uſing their ſacrifice, and worſhipping their falſe Gods was ſuch, that God the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> did loath and abhor them. Such Idolatry I ſay grew among the Iſraelites, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> commanded two Golden Calves to bee made, and to be worſhipped, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Behold O Iſrael behold thy Gods, which brought thée out of the land of Egypt. Theſe were thoſe Iews whom God moſt eſtéemed, and they leaſt regarded it: theſe were his own people, and yet they ſought other Gods, ſaying to <hi>Aaron:</hi> Make us Gods to go before us. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> King of Iuda, erected and made altars to <hi>Baal</hi> to go before him. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophernes</hi> ſaid, that there was no God but <hi>Nabuchadonoſor. Nabuchadonoſor</hi> commanded that all people and nations ſhould knéel and worſhip the Golden Image. <hi>Solomon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received ſo great wiſedom of God, that no Prince in Iſrael had the like, fell in his latter years to Idolatry, to worſhip the Gods of ſtrange women. <hi>Antiochus</hi> commanded Idols to be worſhipped, altars to be erected, temples to be made, ſwine to be ſacrificed, and his own children to paſſe through the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:107135:85"/>Thus was Idolatry maintained, and Calves, Dragons, Serpents, the Sun, the Moon, and all the Stars of heaven were honoured and worſhipped as Gods: inſomuch, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> went to Athens, and ſaw the City ſo addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all kind of Idolatry, his ſpirit was troubled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Thus they made unto themſelves Gods moſt like unto them that made them. For as they heard not the true God and Saviour of the world, perſwading them unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and threatning them with correction: even ſo their fained Gods having ears heard not, having eys ſaw not, having hands felt not, having noſtrils ſmelled not, for all the worſhipping, ſacrifices, and knéeling that they did to them. O miſerable man, to forſake him who is the onely ſaviour and redéemer of man, and to worſhip thoſe Gods which work the onely confuſion of man, I doubt leaſt ſome with the rich glutton make their bellies their Gods: I fear leaſt ſome with <hi>Simon</hi> make money their God: nay I doubt moſt of all leaſt ſome make themſelves Gods with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or with <hi>Darius</hi> King of Perſia, who made an edict, that no man might ask any thing of other Gods for thirty days, but of King <hi>Darius.</hi> The original beginning of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as learned writers affirm, was that the Prince of the world, which is the Divel exerciſing Art, practiſing his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, and ſhifting in ſuch ſundry ſhews, powred ſuch errours into mens hearts (for that prodigious acts and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which Divels, and men by Divels wrought were ſéen) that men were blinded with the ſhifts of Satan which as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid could change himſelf like an angel of light. So that ſome by ſorcery ſome by conjuring, and ſome by the Divel who goeth about like a roring Lyon to increaſe his Kingdome, became Gods on earth: ſome again for ſtrength, ſome for building of Cities, ſome for inventions of things, were had and counted in the number of Gods: as <hi>Iſis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Egyptians, <hi>Gabyrus</hi> amongſt the Macedonians <hi>Mithia</hi> amongſt the Perſians: even ſo by the Rhodians and Meſſagetes was the ſun honoured, amongſt the Latines <hi>Faunus,</hi> by the Romans <hi>Quirinus,</hi> by the Babylonians <hi>Belus,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:107135:85"/>
by the Sabines <hi>Sabius,</hi> by the Moors <hi>Uranios,</hi> and ſo <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Créet, <hi>Apollo</hi> in Delphos, as is afore ſaid. They had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo certain beaſts appointed for their ſacrifices, and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, as an Owl to <hi>Minerva,</hi> a Hart to <hi>Diana,</hi> a Sow to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Ceres,</hi> a Swan to <hi>Venus,</hi> a Cock to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> a Bull to <hi>Neptune,</hi> a Goat to <hi>Faunus,</hi> an Aſſe to <hi>Priapus,</hi> a Heg to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a Gooſe to <hi>Iſis,</hi> a Peacock to <hi>Juno,</hi> beſides this, the Perſians offer to <hi>Phoebus,</hi> a Horſe for a ſacrifice, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians even till the deſtruction of Carthage, offered a child to <hi>Saturn.</hi> The Eagle was appointed for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Phenix for the Sun, the Raven for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the Pie for <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A further ſuperſtition was amongſt the Gentiles, that trées, blocks, and ſuch dumb things were likewiſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and hallowed to their Gods; as the Oak to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Bay to <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Vine to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Poplar to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> the Olive to <hi>Pallas,</hi> the Pine tree to <hi>Cybele,</hi> the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Cypreſſe trée to <hi>Pluto.</hi> Thus with beaſts, birds, blocks and ſtones the Gentiles honored their Gods. There was almoſt nothing in all the whole world, but it had the name of a God. Amongſt the Gentiles, Dogs, Oxen, Calves, Serpents, Dragons, and ſuch others were reputed as Gods.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lacedemonians were wont to excel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nations, in giving growth to their hairs of their heads and beards, as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a comely ſetting forth of man. Wherefore <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did defend the ſame, ſaying, that as the hairs of the head were comely and ſeemly to beautifull men; ſo were they a terror and a fearfull ſight upon the deformed man for the enemies to look upon. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander</hi> therefore being demanded why the Lacedemonians did ſo eſteem their beards, and locks of hair upon their heads, he ſaid, Becauſe it is a moſt natural garment, and moſt comely unto man, to have that which is beſt in ſight and leaſt in charges. The ancient Greeks, and ſpecially the people of Athens, aſſoon as any was once paſt fourteen years of age, had a cuſtome and law that they ſhould be brought to Delphos, to offer their firſt down on their chins, and gay and frizling buſhes of their heads to <hi>Apollo,</hi> as a ſacrifice of their firſt fruit, and a pledge of their homage to that God. So much eſteemed they their hairs, that they thought nothing to be ſo acceptable to <hi>Apollo</hi> as that, who always was painted young.</p>
               <p>The Thracians likewiſe had ſuch regard unto the hair of their heads, that they combed it, and decked it upon their forehead, with curling knots upon long hairs, ſo that their chief care and ſtudy was to trim thoſe which they eſteemed moſt. In India, the ſubjects in all things obeyed their Prince and the Laws, but in ſhaving their hair, which by no means they would agree to. The Argives loved ſo well their hair, that being defeated by the Lacedemonians at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> they ſhaved their hair, and wept and bewailed their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune ſo much, that they vowed never to let their hair grow, before they would recover again Tiria.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:107135:86"/>The Gréeks honoured their long hairs, and ſo eſtéemed their beards, that <hi>Homer</hi> was wont to call them <hi>Careco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It ſhould ſéem that the Macedonians made much of their hairs and beards, for at what time <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, had gathered all his power and force to take his conqueſt in hand, being demanded of his ſouldiers whether in them any thing were to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the wiſe Prince conſidering the great hurt and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that ſhould happen chiefly in wars to thoſe that were long haired or long bearded: and again being loath to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his ſouldiers, for that he knew w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling much at his requeſt, <hi>Parmento</hi> anſwered and ſaid that the Macedonians wot not what you mean thereby: then <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving that his ſouldiers were angry at his deſire, replied, becauſe long hair is dangerous, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the enemies, there is no better hold then by beards or hairs. But it ſeemed that they had rather be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered like men in their beards, then to be conquerors like boyes without beards. As for the Romans their long hair delighted them ſo much, that there was no ſhaving at all, no Barbers known, untill <hi>Pu. Ticinius,</hi> brought certain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers out of Sycilia to Rome. But for the ſpace of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years, Rome nouriſhed their long hair, as that which they beſt delighted in for thoſe times. <hi>Affricanus</hi> was the firſt that ever delighted in Barbers and next to him was <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſucceſſor of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe countries and famous kingdomes, divers others there were that ſo made of their hair, that to obſerve orders, and to avoid the dangers in the wars, they did ſhave divers parts of their head, much againſt their will; yet for cuſtome ſake the <hi>Maxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107135:87"/>
the hinder part of the head, where they ſuffer their hair to grow very long. The Maceans ſhave little hair upon the crowns of their heads, and yet ſuffer all their hair to hang down in order about their faces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his fourth book doth name a people who are called Machleis and Abantes, which for that they be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and always in the field face to face with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they ſhave their hair before, and ſuffer it to grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. The Euboians likewiſe did let their hair grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind upon their backs very long, and yet were enforced of neceſſity to cut it before for fear of the enemies. It ſeemed that either Barbers were ſcant, or not known in thoſe days, or elſe long hair was much ſet by, and eſteemed of all men. For <hi>Sueronius</hi> that writ the lives of the Emperors, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the Emperor <hi>Caligula</hi> was wont for envy to thoſe he met, to ſhave their hair off behind, knowing well, that nothing might moleſt them ſo much, as to have their hair off; for he was ſo envious, that if he ſaw any that had fair golden hair, he would have it off ſtraight with his own hand,</p>
               <p>Beards were ſo much ſet by, and ſo eſtéemed was hair in thoſe days, that women were forbidden by the Law of the twelve fables, to ſhave any part of the face, to prove whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hair might grow or no. Occaſions were miniſtred to them, ſaid they, by their long hair and beards to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the ſtate of their bodies. For an old man in the City of Sparta being asked why he did wear his beard ſo long, he anſwered, That in beholding the gray hairs in my beard, I may do nothing unſéemly, nor unworthy of ſuch gray hairs; for a good man is always admoniſhed to live vertuouſly. <hi>Demonax</hi> was known by his beard to be ſome grave Philoſopher, by him that demanded of him what kind of philoſophy he profeſſed, not knowing him otherwiſe then by his beard. The tyrant <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> to ſpight the Citizens of Epidaurus, took the golden beard of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> away out of the temple, to move them to greater diſpleaſure. At what time <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> was brought to <hi>Simus</hi> houſe, the Phrigian,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107135:87"/>
which was ſo dreſſed with cloth of Arras, and precious han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings that the very floors ſo gorgeouſly ſhined, that he could not find in the houſe a place to ſpit, without ſome offence, he ſpit in his handkercher, and threw it into <hi>Simus</hi> face, who was all bearded; he being angry therewith demanded the cauſe why he ſo little eſteemed him: Becauſe, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtippus,</hi> I ſaw not in all the houſe ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul a place as that, which ſhould have béen moſt clean, (meaning his beard.) And though it was merrily done of <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> yet it was not ſo merrily thought of <hi>Simus,</hi> who more eſtéemed his beard, then <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> eſteemed all his precious cloaths, and golden hangings. The like did <hi>Jeronimus</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Rhetris</hi> make of his beard; for when I ſée (ſaid he) my beard, then I know right well that I am a man and nor a woman; and then knowing my ſelf to be a man, I am aſhamed to do any thing like a woman, either in word or déed. Much more might be here alledged for the authority of beards and for eſtéeming of long hair; for there is no countrey, be if ever ſo civil, but it is addicted to ſome peculiar qualities; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any man, be he ever ſo wiſe, but doth glory in one thing more then in another: As the wiſe man in his wiſedome, the learned man in his knowledge, the ignorant man in his folly, the proud man in his perſon, the ſelf-lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ſome part of his body more then in other, either in his face, body, leg, middle, foot, hand or hair, and ſpecially many do make much account of their beard, combing, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, handling and ſetting it in order always. But becauſe people are mutable and full of change, and that time alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, we will no further procéed in this though men may miſ-judge of others concerning their long hair and beards; yet I ſay judgement is not ſafe in this point: for it may be that they prefer the country Poet <hi>Heſiodus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the warlike and eloquent <hi>Homer,</hi> as <hi>Panis</hi> King of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, or as <hi>Mydas</hi> did judge <hi>Pan</hi> the Piper before <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of Muſick. Hard it is to judge of men whether the bearded man, or the beardleſs man is to be preferred, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the long hair or the ſhort hair moſt to be eſteemed; for

under ſtrange habits are concealed hidden qualities, and under a ragged cloak (as the Greek proverb is) lyeth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as ſecretly as under a Velvet gown.</p>

               <p>The Romans had this cuſtome, that if any man of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and credit ſhould die, his ſons and daughters, his nigh kinſmen and beſt beloved friends, as <hi>Cicero</hi> doth write of <hi>Metellus,</hi> did put him in the fire made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſſe he were one of the Emperours, whoſe funeral pomp was much more ſumptuous: for then his body was to be carried to the market or common Hall of Rome: on the ſecond day he was to be carried by certain young noble men to <hi>Martius</hi> field, where a great pile of wood was raiſed much like a Tower, and there after much ſolemnity and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies done, he that ſuccéeded him as an Emperour, did firſt put fire to that work, and then all men were buſie to ſée the body burned: and when they had burned him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, they would let an Eagle flie from the top of ſome high Tower, which as they ſuppoſed ſhould carry his ſoul unto heaven. The Aſſyrians did uſe to anoint the dead bodies with honey and wax, and with ſtudy and care did preſerve them from putrifaction. Such ſtrange order of burial was in India, that the women of that country thought there could be no greater fame nor worthier renown, then to bee burned and buried together with their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
               <p>The Thracians are much to be commended herein, who at the birth of any of their friends children, uſe to wéep, and bewail the miſery and calamity that man is born to; and at the death of any of their friends, they rejoice with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107135:89"/>
ſuch mirth and gladneſſe that they paſt theſe worldly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that at the burial of them even when the corps doth go out of the houſe, they altogether ſay with one voice, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel friend; go before, and we will follow after. So the corps goeth before, and all his friends follow after him with trumpets, muſick, and great mirth for joy that he is gone out of the vale of miſery. <hi>Plato</hi> that divine Greek and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Philoſopher, made the like laws in Athens that when any of the chief officers ſhould die, he appointed that no mourning weeds ſhould be worn there, but all in white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and that fifteen young maids, and fifteen young boys ſhould ſtand round about the corps in white garments, while the Prieſts commended his life to the people in an open o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then he was brought very orderly to the grave, all the young children ſinging their country hymns, and the ancient men following after them, and the grave was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with fair broad ſtones, where the name of the dead, with his vertuous commendations and great praiſe was ſet upon the ſtone. The like grave the Italians uſe at this day, and divers other countries. And as theſe and others had the like ceremonies to the praiſe and commendations of the dead: ſo others little eſteemed and regarded ſuch things, inſomuch that the Perſians were never buried till Fowls of the ayr and dogs did eat ſome part thereof. The Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes thought it moſt infamous that any of their friends ſhould die by ſickneſſe, but if the Parents waxed old, the children and the next kinſmen they had, did eat them up, ſuppoſing that their fleſh was more méet for them to eat, then by worms or any other beaſts to be devoured. The people called Tibareni, had a cuſtome that thoſe whom they loved beſt in their youth, thoſe would they hang in their age; even ſo the Albans being inhabitants about mount <hi>Cancaſus,</hi> thought it unlawfull for any to care for the dead, but ſtraight buried them, as Nabatheans bury their Kings and rulers in dung-hils. The burial of the Parthians was nothing elſe but to commend them to the birds of the air. The Naſomones when they bury their friends, they ſet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107135:89"/>
them in the grave ſitting. But of all moſt cruelly deal the Caſpians and the Hircanians, which kill their parents, their wives, their brethren, their kinſmen and friends, and put them in the high way half quick, half dead for to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of birds and beaſts. The faſhion and cuſtome with the Iſſidones, a rude people in ſome part of Scithia, as <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> in his fourth book affirmeth, is to call their neighbours and friends together were the dead lie, and there merrily ſinging and banquetting, they eat the fleſh of the dead, and make the ſcull of the dead a drinking cup, and cover it with gold to drink withall. Again the people called Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei, think no better grace for their friends, vvhen they be old then to bring them to ſome high bank of vvater or great rock, and thence after much feaſting, eating and drinking, in the middeſt of their mirth, their own friends do throw them down into the water headlong To ſeek into hiſtories, many ſuch burials might be found amongſt ſo many rude and barbarous nations. Notwithſtanding in divers regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the funerals of the dead are ſo eſteemed, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt infamy, the ſevereſt puniſhment for any offendour, vvas not to be buried; this the Athenians uſed tovvards thoſe that vvere traitors to their country, and the Egyptians if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lived amiſſe, he ſhould be carried dead to the vvilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be devoured of vvild beaſts. The Perſians like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought the bodies of men condemned to be eaten of dogs. The Lybians thought them moſt worthy of ſolemn buriall that died either in wars, or were killed by wild beaſts. The Macedonians had great care in burying the dead ſouldiers in the field. Amongſt the Gentiles there were certain days appointed for mourning at the death of their friends. <hi>Licurgus</hi> law amongſt the Lacedemonians was that they ſhould mourn but eleven days. <hi>Numa Pompil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> decreed that children after their parents death, the wives, their husbands, &amp;c. ſhould mourn ten moneths, though by the Senatours it was enacted in the wars at Canna that the Romans ſhould mourn but thirty days. Amongſt the Egyptians they had a cuſtome to mourn after their kings
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107135:90"/>
died thréeſcore and twelve days, but generally the moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was to bewail the dead nine days. In ſome places mourning was forbidden at their burial, as at Athens by the law of <hi>Solon,</hi> in Locretia, in Thracia, in Coos, in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia and in divers other places. The diverſity of mourning was ſuch, that amongſt the Gréeks they ſhaved their heads and beards, and threw them into the grave with the dead. Amongſt the Lacedemonians when the Kings of Sparta died, certain horſemen were appointed to travell over all the whole Kingdome, certifying the death of the King, and the women in every city, did beat their braſen pots, and made a great and heavy noiſe for the ſoone; the Egyptians did mourn after this ſort, they rent their cloathes, and did ſhut their temples, they did eat no meat, and beſmearing their faces with dirt, they abſtained from waſhing their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thréeſcore and twelve days, all which time they lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bewailed the death of their Kings and friends; the Carthaginians at their funerals did cut their hair of, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle their faces, and did beat their breaſts. The Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans likewiſe did ſhave their hair bewailing the death of their friends, as we read of <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of Macedonia, who ſhaved his hair at the burial of his friend <hi>Euripides;</hi> the Argives and the Siracuſans did accompany the dead to the grave in white cloaths diſcoloured with water and clay; the Matrons of Rome threw off their fine apparel, their rings and chains, and did wear black garments, at the burial of their friends, but I burn candle in the day time, to write of ſuch infinit ceremonies that the Gentiles had at their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials: therefore better to end with a few examples, then to weary the reader with too many hiſtories, for all men know that all people have their ſeveral manners, as well in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as in dying, which they alter according to the vital cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of perſon, place, and time.</p>

               <p>Neither may we ſo little eſteem the authority of grave and learned men, in divers of their aſſertions concerning ſights and viſions, though divers fables be alledged and avouched for truth, with ſimple and ignorant men. We read in the ſacred ſcriptures, divers ſights ſeen, divers viſions appearing, and ſundry voices heard. We read that King <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> being in his princely banquets, ſaw a hand writing upon the wall over againſt where he ſat at table, what his end ſhould be, It is read in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third chapter of the ſecond of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> that a horſe appeared unto <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> who was ſervant to <hi>Seleucus</hi> King of Syria, as he was about to deſtroy the temple at Ieruſalem, and upon the horſe ſeemed to be a terrible man, which made towards him to overcome him, and on each ſide of him were two young men of excellent beauty, who with whips ſcourged <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> There alſo appeared to <hi>Machabeus,</hi> a horſeman in ſhining armor all of gold, ſhaking his ſpear, to ſignifie the famous victory that <hi>Machabeus</hi> ſhould obtain.</p>

                  <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth in the wars of the Danes, and <hi>Appianus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth in the wars at Rome, what ſigns and wonders, what miſerable cryes of men, claſhing of armor, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of horſes were heard, inſomuch that the ſame day that <hi>Caeſar</hi> fought his battel with <hi>Cn.

But I will omit to ſpeak of ſuch things, and take in hand to intreat of ſpirits, which were both ſeen and heard of learned men, and of viſions ſuppoſed of the wiſeſt to be the ſouls of dead men: for <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth in the life of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that ſundry men, who were in the battel of Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonia againſt the Medians, affirmed that they ſaw the ſoul of <hi>Theſeus</hi> armed before the hoſt of Greeks, as chief Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Captain, running and ſetting on the barbarous Medians, whom the Athenians afterward, for that cauſe onely, honoured as a God.</p>
               <p>It is reported by Hiſtoriographers, that <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> have been ſeen often in battels after their deaths, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on white horſes, and fighting againſt their enemies in camp, inſomuch that <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifieth, that they were ſeen of many in the battel againſt <hi>Tarquinius.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the Gentiles dreams were ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the vain ſuperſtitious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſame, was the whole truſt and hope of their countries, and of their own lives; when the Kings of India take their reſt, they were brought to bed with all kind of melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and harmony, every day knéeling upon his knées, beſéeching <hi>Morpheus</hi> the God of ſléep to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal thoſe things unto their King that ſhould be commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profitable to the ſubjects. They thought themſelves well inſtructed when either by Oracles they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or elſe by viſions ſuggeſted. King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> knew well that his dying day was at hand, when he beſieged the City of <hi>Argos,</hi> and ſaw in the market place a braſen Woolf, and a Bull, which the Argives for memory of things paſt, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient monuments had put up, for he by an Oracle did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, at what time he ſhould ſée a Bull and a Woolf fighting together, he ſhould then prepare himſelf to die. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great, after that the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Ammon</hi> was pronounced that he ſhould be unconquered, he doubted not but to ſubdue the whole world, and ſo truſting more to the Oracle of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> then the mutability of fortune he took upon him the conqueſt of all the world, attempting nothing at all without ſome Oracle or dream had warned him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For till the great Conqueror <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſéen <hi>Hercules</hi> in his ſléep reaching out of the wal his hand, promiſing him his aid and help in his wars, he had not ſo boldly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo high an enterpriſe without fear and dread,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:107135:95"/>In the like manner, unto <hi>Hannibal</hi> after long perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, with great induſtry &amp; ſtudy how he might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy &amp; deſtroy the Roman Empire, there appeared a young man of wonderfull beauty, who told him, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſent him as a Captain before him into Italy, whereby ſtraight he was encouraged the rather to take the charge in hand, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping therby to enjoy triumphant victory over his enemies. <hi>Caeſar</hi> that mighty Prince &amp; Monarch, &amp; the firſt Emperor that ever poſſeſſed Rome, thought in his ſleep that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with his own mother, which when it was opened by the Soothſayers, and declared that it was the earth that was his mother, and that he ſhould ſuppreſſe all the Princes of the earth under him, he vvas enſiamed thereby to vvars, perſwading himſelf that he ſhould be a conqueror over all the world.</p>
               <p>After that the noble &amp; renowned Greek <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was exiled from Athens and baniſhed the confines of Greece, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſuch ſervice and honour to his countrey, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> worthily mentioneth, for the ſubduing of proud <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of Perſia the great enemy of all Gréece, being in great peril and danger of life in ſtrange countreys, he ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſee in his ſleep, a Dragon creeping upward from his belly towards his face, and as ſoon as the Dragon touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his face, he was changed (as he thought) to an Eagle, and carried by the Eagle a great way through the Ayr into a ſtrange countrey, where the Eagle gave him a golden ſtaff in his hand, and ſo left him: Whereby ſtraight he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he was not onely delivered from all dangers, but alſo ſhould be ſought for by all Greece, to the encreaſe of his fame, and augmentation of his honour. <hi>Brutus</hi> clean contrary, after much good ſucceſſe and proſperous fortune, after he murthered <hi>Caeſar,</hi> at length he was in his ſleep by a viſion warned to make himſelf ready to die at Philippi, where he was enforced in the wars between <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> and him to kill himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus were they allured and entiſed to uncertain dreams, to order and rule all their doings. For as the Poet <hi>Ennius</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:107135:95"/>
ſaith, what they ſtudied and pondered in the day time, the ſame dreamed they in the night time. Dreams moved the Heathen to tyranny; for <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> the Firebrand of Italy, was warned in his ſleep by <hi>Bellona</hi> the Goddeſſe of wars, to murther kill and deſtroy all that ever he might find in his way, giving him in his hand, fire, in token he ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Rome and Italy. Likewiſe <hi>Eumenes</hi> King of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, having wars with <hi>Antipater</hi> King of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, was fully perſwaded by a dream to obtain victory; for he dreamed that two <hi>Alexanders</hi> were with great hoſts and armies of men ready in the field to fight, the one having the Goddeſſe <hi>Minerva</hi> as a leader, the other having the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Ceres</hi> as their Captain, and after long conflicts and much ſlaughter on both parties he thought that the ſouldiers of <hi>Ceres</hi> had the victory, and that they were crowned with ears of corn in the honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> which is the Goddeſs of corn: And becauſe the country of Lacedemonia was more fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>til then Macedonia, the wiſe Sages declared the dream, &amp; ſaid, that <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſhould have the victory over Macedonia.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe dreams, they had a kind of credit in fowls of the ayr, in beaſts of the field, in wind and weather, and in divers other things, where Soothſaying Oracles and conſultations were had. When <hi>Xerxes</hi> the great King of Perſia, with ſo many Myriades of men, had purpoſed and decreed with himſelf to deſtroy all Greece, a Mare (being a ſtout and a proud beaſt) brought forth a Hare (a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and timerous creature) whereby the flight of <hi>Xerxes</hi> from Greece with ſhame and reproach was preſaged. And afterward, before he would lay ſiege to Athens, reſolving with himſelf to deſtroy Sparta, &amp; all the country of Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, a ſtrange warning happened to this Prince at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for his Wine before his face was converted into Bloud as it was filled in the cups, not once, but twice or thrice whereat he being amazed, conſulted with Wiſe men, of whom he was then admoniſhed to forſake his firſt intent, and to give over the enterprize which he took in hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Greeks.</p>

                  <hi>Midas</hi> being yet in his cradle, the Ants were ſéen to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grains and victuals to féed him withal; whoſe parents being deſirous to know the effect thereof, were certified by the Soothſayers, that he ſhould be the wealthieſt and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man in the world, and the moſt monied Prince that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould reign in India. <hi>Plato,</hi> that noble and divine phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, while he was an infant in like ſort in his cradle, the Bees with honey fed his ſugred and ſwéet lips, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eloquence and learning in time to come. They were not Bees of mount Himettum, but rather of Helicon, where the Muſes, and Ladies of learning delighted to dwell. This was that <hi>Plato</hi> of whom his maſter <hi>Socrates</hi> before he knew him, dreamed, that he held faſt in his hand a young Swan, which fled from him away, and mounted the skies, whoſe ſweet voice and ſongs, as a wonderfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody and harmony, repleniſhed the whole skies. They thought it a ſufficient admonition to ſee any thing happen between birds or beaſts, as a ſure and certain ſhew of their own fortune to come.</p>

                     </gap>ops</hi> the firſt King of Athens before the time of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> firſt framed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed matrimony in Gréece: But ſuch were their orders in divers places, ſuch was their liberties in matrimony, that the Egyptians the Indians, and the Thracians might marry as many as they would according to the ability of the man: ſome ten, ſome twelve, ſome more ſome leſſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain amongſt the Scythians, the Perſians, and all Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their wives, and daughters were common one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like bruit beaſts. The Meſſagetes had this law, that it was not to be ſuffered that any of their country ſhould marry but one wiſe, but it was lawfull for any man to take another mans wife, and to make an exchange, for ſo were their wives common to all, but married to one. In <hi>Lybia</hi> the people called Augylas, and the people called Naſamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, had this order in their matrimonies, that the Bride the firſt night after ſhe was married, ſhould lie with every gueſt before ſhe ſhould go to bed to her own husband. The Arabians law was, that one woman ſhould be married to all her kinſmen, and at all times lawfull for any of her kin to challenge and claim her as his wife, uſing this policy, to leave a ſtaff at the chamber door, to give to underſtand that one was in bed with her: and when the ſtaff was not there, then they knew that no body was within, and if any were found of another kindred, it was adultery, and by law he ſhould die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polydorus</hi> reciteth a Hiſtory for the purpoſe to be noted, That there was a Kings daughter of great beauty, which had fifteen tall men to her brethren, with whom ſeverally
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107135:99"/>
oftentimes ſhe did accompany; and being almoſt wearied, deſirous to take ſome reſt (for ſhe was ſo fair, and they ſo many, that always ſhe had company) ſhe uſed this pollicy; to make a ſtaff much like to the chamber ſtaff, which was as it were a Porter appointed to give notice: Afterwards upon a time one of her brethren had left her in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and was gone out, ſhe ſtraight laid the ſtaff at the door, thinking thereby ſomthing to eaſe her ſelf, and to reſt from venery; but one of her brethren came from the market, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left all his brethren there, and when he ſaw the ſtaff at the door, went ſtraight to his father, and accuſed his ſiſter of adultery, ſaying, that all his brethren were in the market, and that there was a fornicator with his ſiſter: But the matter being known, he was puniſhed by his father for that he ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndered his ſiſter.</p>
               <p>The like liberty in matrimony was ſometimes amongſt the Medes, and with the people called Magi, Anthropopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi, and with divers others. Some of Aethiopia, and ſome of Arabia married their own mothers and ſiſters. Thus people in divers manners did lead their lives, and do lead their lites ſo horribly and filthily, that better it were not to know it then to know it: But though it be a play and a ſport to the ungodly and wicked, yet it is a horror and ugly monſter to the godly and wiſe; for to know all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth the good. <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his fourth book doth mention certain inhabitants called <hi>Poeni,</hi> approaching the confines of Egypt, whoſe order and law of matrimony was, that the King of that country ſhould have the firſt taſte of the Bride before her husband. This order was once obſerved by the ancient Scots, that the Lord of the ſoil ſhould have the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity of the married woman.</p>
               <p>The Aſſyrians and Babylonians did ſometimes marry thoſe that hired their bodies to all men. The people called Cantabri gave money as a dowry with their wives to other men. The daughters of the Lydians and the Cyprians might not marry till they had gained by the hire of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as much as ſhould pay their dowry. In the mean time
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107135:100"/>
did they go from City to City, from town to town, offering themſelves to every man upon the high way; and when they had gained ſufficiently for their dowry, then might they marry, and not before. And thus were there ſundry orders, and ſeveral laws to maintain the ſame. Some again did lead a life without women, as the Eſſeni which <hi>Pliny</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that they live moſt ſober and chaſt without women all their life time: Alſo certain people of Thrace called <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtae,</hi> did likewiſe avoid the company of women.</p>
               <p>The Romans after Rome was built five hundred years and more, kept matrimony inviolated, till <hi>Sputinus</hi> a noble Roman, becauſe of the barrenneſs of his wife, had a divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment granted him, when <hi>Pomponius</hi> and <hi>Papitius</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls in Rome. <hi>Moſes</hi> perceiving the Iews much to be given to ſeveral vices, ſome to covetouſneſſe, ſome to lechery, for the reformation of domeſtick quietneſſe, and becauſe the Iews were deſirous of other women, either for beauty, or for wealth, they had a divorcement granted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the fury and hardneſſe of their hearts, which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avoid the tyranny of the Iews which they uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their firſt wives, and by ſufferance then by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. For as the world in moſt places was too wicked concerning the liberty of Matrimony; ſo were they in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countreys very ſtraight concerning Marriages, in ſo much, that the Ethnicks obſerved that ſentence of <hi>Catullus</hi> the Poet, that virginity ought to be ruled by the parents, ſith one part is the fathers, the ſecond is the mothers, and the third and laſt is in the child. The ſolemnity in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in divers places, imported unto us wiſe morals, and did as it were preſage a duty and an obedience to things as both <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> write of the Venetians, that when a Marriage was ſolemnized in Venice, the Bride after that day bringeth her diſtaff, and her ſpindle, and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>x ready, as one after that day never to be idle, but occupied always in ſhe affairs of her houſe.</p>
               <p>The Greeks and Romans alſo had this cuſtome; they girded the loyns of their daughters alwayes till the day of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107135:100"/>
their marriages, and then that night her husband ſhould looſe the knot, and unbind that which of long time the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of Greece kept faſt bound. Amongſt divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, where ſundry ſolemnities in matrimony are uſed, I read not in any Hiſtory, ſo ſolemn a ſtate, and ſo worthy ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as we do ſee in England, which if you mark in all points, you muſt néeds confeſſe, that outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies do import a great Majeſty and Dignity in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>Again, they had laws in divers places, that none might marry without ſome reverence ſhewed to their Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as the Athenians ſuffered no marriage without ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice firſt done to <hi>Diana;</hi> In Rome a law there was, that ſhe that ſhould be married ſhould ſit in the ſeat of <hi>Faunus</hi> before ſhe might ſee the Bridegroom her husband: The like was obſerved in Boetia and Locreſia, that before their youth ſhould marry they ſhould drink one to another at the altar conſecrated to Euelia. In Hetruria they uſed to kill a hog to ſacrifice to their Gods, and to call upon <hi>Juno</hi> for good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to come. In Luſitania the Bride goes to Church with a diſtaff and a ſpindle in her hand, and one of her kinſmen going before her with a firebrand of Pine tree. In Sparta by the law of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the maids that ſhould marry, ſhould ſhave the hairs of their heads, and wear mans apparel; and by the ſame law they were forbidden to give any ſubſtance with their daughters, but love and good will was to be the whole cauſe of marriage.</p>
               <p>Moreover they uſed theſe ceremonies; To divide a peece of bread in Macedonia, and in the moſt part of Greece, for the Bride and the Bridegroom to eat before they ſhould be married. The like in Rome in <hi>Romulus</hi> time was uſed. In Galatia they did both drink firſt of one cup appointed for that purpoſe onely. And ſo forth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countreys they uſed divers ceremonies; as in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia no man might marry, without he brought the head of ſome enemy or other to the King, as a proof of his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:107135:101"/>In <hi>Maeous</hi> no maid might marry, without ſhe had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted one enemy or other of her Countrey. But in ſome countreys they married not, as the Eſſeni, a people much given to abſtain as well from Wine as from Women. Wherefore <hi>Socrates</hi> being demanded what was beſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to marry, or no; anſwered, If you marry you ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer brawling and chiding; if you are ſingle, you ſhall be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and comfortleſſe. Therefore <hi>Pompey</hi> the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming among the Maſſagetes, who uſed once a week to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with their wives demanded the cauſe thereof: They anſwered, Becauſe we would not hear their chidings in the day time nor their complaints in the night time. But to end, let every man have his own wife, if he cannot live chaſt, for better it is to marry then to burn.</p>

And even ſo <hi>Publicola</hi> did not onely imitate <hi>Solon</hi> in all points, but alſo tranſlated <hi>Solons</hi> laws to Rome, ſo that one was counted moſt ſage and wiſe in Greece, the other thought to be moſt happy in Rome.

the firſt a Harp, the ſecond a Pipe, the third a Flute. In the chapter of the invention of things, you ſhall at large find more concerning muſick. But now to declare the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of muſick, the mirth and melody that procéeds from muſick, the love and affection that antient Princes and gravewiſe men bare to muſick: <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> though he was wiſe and diſcréet in other things, yet for that, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith in his firſt book of <hi>Tuſculans,</hi> he refuſed to hear one play on the Harp in a banquet where he was, he then of the wiſeſt men in Athens was thought and judged to be of leſſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than they ſuppoſed him to be: For the Greeks judged none to be learned, unleſſe he were experienced in muſick: <hi>Socrates</hi> the father of all philoſophy, and maſter of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers being by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> named and judged the wiſeſt man in all the world in his latter years being an old man was taught to play upon the Harp, and often found amongſt little children: he being taunted of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> for that he found him playing with a little infant called <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proces,</hi> anſwered: it is good being to be in good company. Even ſo that wiſe and diſcreet Prince <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> king ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of the Lacedemonians, ſpying one of his men to laugh at him for that he rode upon a long reed with one of his children, ſaid: hold thy peace and laugh not, and when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſhalt be a father, thou muſt do as a father. We read the like of noble <hi>Architas</hi> the Tarentine, who when he was married, having a great number of ſervants in his houſe, he would play with their children and delighted much in the company of young infants.

               <p>That mighty and ſtrong <hi>Hercules</hi> though he was the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and counted in all the world moſt famous, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a God taken then a man, as <hi>Euripides</hi> doth teſtifie, would be often found amongſt children and young inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent infants playing, ſaying this ſentence with a child in

his hand: I play with children which for the change there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſo grateful unto me, as though I were in the games of Olimpia. The ſelf-ſame famous <hi>Hercules</hi> went to ſchool to <hi>Livius</hi> to learn to play upon the Harp to ſolace him in his ſadneſſe, and to make him merry when he was compelled to mourn. In the middeſt of his triumph went that great Conquerour <hi>Alexander</hi> likewiſe to learn muſick. That divine and godly Prophet <hi>David</hi> played upon his Harp, and ſerved his God with hymns and godly ballads. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that in the marriage of King <hi>Cadmus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> who builded Thebes in Boetia, the Muſes played on inſtruments.</p>
               <p>In Gréece muſick was ſo eſteemed, that their ſages and wiſe Philoſophers addicted themſelves wholly to muſick. The Arcadians, the Lacedemonians, and the Thracians, though they were people much given to wars, ſevere in dealing, hardy in all travels, and in learning moſt inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, yet would they acquaint themſelves with muſick till they were thirty years old The people of Créet brought up their youth in all kind of melody and harmony. The moſt part of the world did learn muſick, ſave in Egypt, where, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> in his ſecond book affirmeth, muſick was forbidden, leaſt the tender and ſoft minds of their youth ſhould be inticed to too much pleaſure. And though ſome contemn muſick with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and ſay that it were more profitable to mend manners then to learn muſick: and ſome with <hi>Alcibiades</hi> deſpiſe muſick, who was wont to ſay that the Thebans were méet men to learn muſick, for that they could not ſpeak, but that the Athenians ſhould hate ſuch wanton tunes, for that they ſpake without inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Likewiſe King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> being demaanded which was the beſt muſitian, <hi>Python</hi> or <hi>Chariſius,</hi> he deſpiſing them and their muſick, preferred a great warriour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own mind, named <hi>Polyſperches:</hi> though theſe I ſay with divers others deſpiſed muſick, yet we read again as wiſe as they, as ſtout as they, uſed much muſick, as <hi>Aca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which was ſuch a terrour to the enemies, the people of <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena,</hi> that at the firſt ſound of the trumpets they fled, and ſo the Lacedemonians got the victory; thus was the ancient muſick in the beginning ſo neceſſary, that every country indeavoured to have skil in muſick: then <hi>Mars</hi> claimed muſick in the field, now <hi>Venus</hi> onely exerciſeth muſick in chambers.</p>
               <p>This is that kind of gentle and ſoft muſick the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans forbad the youth to be taught, leſt from men they would become again women; but ſhall we join the old ancient games, the mirth the ſolace, and the plays that they uſed in thoſe days, together with their muſick, to prove the agility of that time, and the activities of that age to be much eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amongſt the Gréeks and Gentiles. The Gréeks had four great games appointed: the firſt in mount Olimpia in Arcadia, hard by the City Piſa which <hi>Hercules</hi> invented firſt to honour <hi>Iupiter:</hi> this was ſo famous amongſt the Greeks that even as the Romans uſed to account their time by their Conſuls, ſo did the Greeks uſe to number by the games of Olimpia, which was appointed every fifth year. Vnto this game came all the youth of the world, both on horſeback and on foot, to do maſteries, the reward was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the victors a Garland made of Olive leaves for they came not there for money, but for mirth and exerciſe' inſomuch that when <hi>Tigranes</hi> King <hi>Artabanus</hi> ſon heard of the fame thereof, and of the Garlands of Olive, he ſaid: Well worthy were the Greeks to be ſpoken of, that ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſtéemed money, the Olive was preferred for the chief reward in Olympia. This ſame moved firſt King <hi>Xerxes</hi> to wax againſt the Greeks to his loſſe and decay. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond games were called <hi>Pithii,</hi> and invented of <hi>Apollo</hi> in memory that he killed the great Serpent <hi>Python,</hi> which was of <hi>Iuno</hi> ſent to kill <hi>Latona, Apollo</hi> his mother. Here was appointed for the victors either on foot or on horſeback, a garland made of Oken leaves. Here likewiſe all the youth of Greece exerciſed feats, practiſed policies, uſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and proved themſelves in any thing that they felt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107135:106"/>
themſelves apt to perform, as in running, leaping, wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, riding, ſwimming or ſuch like as then was uſed; the third was called <hi>Iſthmia,</hi> invented of <hi>Theſeus</hi> in the honour of Neptune. In this play was appointed for the victors certain garlands made of Pine leaves, having the name of <hi>Iſthmos,</hi> a place in Achaia where <hi>Neptune</hi> is worſhipped. The fourth game is called <hi>Nemea,</hi> which the Argives make in memory of <hi>Hercules,</hi> for that he killed a great fierce Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the woods of <hi>Nemea,</hi> according to the name of the play. Here do likewiſe the Argives come to exerciſe youth, and practiſe feats as the reſt do; theſe four plays were long in Greece obſerved, as cauſes and occaſions for men to come together, to ſhew feates and to try qualities: the firſt in <hi>Olimpus</hi> for <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the ſecond in Delos for <hi>Apollo,</hi> the third in <hi>Iſthmos</hi> a place in Achaia for <hi>Neptune,</hi> the fourth amongſt the Argives to <hi>Hercules.</hi> In the firſt play the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of victory was made of Olive, in the ſecond play the garland of victory was of Oke, in the third play they had their garlands of Pine, in the fourth play of Poplar; and thus then they triumphed in their mirth, they joied in their victories they gloried in their garlands while the Lawrel as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaid was not known. Beſides theſe four famous plays, there were divers others, as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> play which he invented in Creet, for the ſouldiers to exerciſe themſelves in arms, wherein he taught divers geſtures and ſundry po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures whence firſt procéeded the uſe of wars: this was a kind of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncing in arms, as <hi>Dioniſius Hali</hi> in his ſeventh book ſaith, which was by the people called Curetes, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the memory of <hi>Pyrrhus. Licaon</hi> likewiſe invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other kind of plaies, where naked men, contrary to <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> games, did uſe feats of activity. Divers other games were had in great eſtimation in Greece, being made and invented of men, but the firſt inventeur of mirth was as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mercurius,</hi> which onely was invented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the people, and to practiſe agility and feats of bodies. Others there were of leſſe name, but of as great mirth, as divers kinds of playing at the Ball, which is an ancient
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107135:106"/>
game as it ſéemeth in <hi>Virgil,</hi> and it was much uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time amongſt the Troyans, for when <hi>Aeneas</hi> immediately after the deſtruction of Troy came unto Italy, he taught the exerciſe of the ball, before he married <hi>Lavinia</hi> King <hi>Latinus</hi> daughter; and at this day it is much uſed in divers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>Again, for further recreation, they uſed ſundry kinds of playing at dice. <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth witneſſe that the old and ancient Lidians did firſt find out the dice and Ball, though <hi>Plini</hi> doth report that one named <hi>Pythus</hi> firſt found the play at the Ball: but for the certainty thereof, ſince ſo many balls there are, and the playing likewiſe is ſo variable, both <hi>Plini</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> may well agree: for the people of Lydia at a certain time being oppreſſed with great dearth, and ſo plagued with hunger, they invented then divers kinds of games at dice, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirms to paſs the time in playing, &amp; to forget hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, for they fed one day, &amp; they came together the ſecond day to play: thus eating a little one day to ſatisfie nature, they plaied the ſecond day to forget hunger. Again, there was amongſt the ancient Gréeks a play much like unto our cheſſe play, which one <hi>Xerxes</hi> a wiſe man firſt invented to warn a tyrannous prince, which he their ſerved, to forſake his tyranny, and to let him underſtand by his play, that a Prince ought to be vigilant, and to uſe his ſubjects as his force and ſtrength, even as the play is in moving the Pawns, the Knights, the Biſhops for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and bulwarks of the King; thus as the player I mean <hi>Xerxes</hi> did ſhew his maſter the King the effect of the play, how the King was preſerved by playing wiſely of the men leſt they be loſt, ſo the tyrant himſelf underſtood by the play of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> how dangerous that Princes ſtate is, that uſeth not well his ſubjects, nor diſcréetly ſée and watch for their commodities, which is the Princes ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Another play was uſed then in Gréece, either upon the Dice, or elſe cloſely in hand, called Even and odde. This play came from Greece unto Rome, in the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107135:107"/>
Caeſar</hi> the ſecond Emperor of Rome, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> doth write in the life of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wrote a Letter unto his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Rome, after this ſort Daughter, I ſend thee two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Seſtercij, which I give amongſt thy gueſts, to play after ſupper, the Greek play called Even and odde, whether it be at Dice, or cloſe in hand. Lets likewiſe were much uſed for recreation and mirth, with divers other ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry games and plays to recreate the mind of man, which both the Greeks and Gentiles did practiſe, as well to try their wits, as alſo to uſe paſtime and mirth, to draw compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny together to be merry.</p>
               <p>I leave the Gréeks a while, and will ſpeak ſomething of the Roman paſtimes and ſports, which in nothing were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Gréeks, but rather excelled Gréece, and all the world in all qualities. And leſt I ſhould ſeem tedious, I will ſpeak of no more but four principal games, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to the Greeks, and coequal to their number. The firſt called <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> brought out of Arcadia by <hi>Evander,</hi> and ſacrificed to <hi>Pan</hi> upon mount Palentine: And as <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> doth write, the ſacrifices were made in the moneth of February after this ſort; The young men of Rome did convene together, every one bearing in his hand a ſcourge, or a whip made of Goats skins, running one to another, and he that was moſt ſwift of foot, eſcaped ſtripes; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was to run to another in order, every one his length before the other; and thus they made themſelves ſwifter in running by reaſon of the ſtripes, for he that was overtaken by the way, was ſure to feel the blow: Every man ran na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to this end, that they might be the ſwifter. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men likewiſe, thinking thereby to become more fruitfull and fertil, offered themſelvs willingly to receive the ſtripes of the ratling thongs. Theſe ſcourges and whips that they had in their hands made ſuch a noiſe, by reaſon they were made of dry skins, that if made him that ran before to ſtrain himſelf hearing the noiſe, and fearing the ſtripes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond game that the Romans uſed, was called <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes;</hi> ſome ſay it ſprung up firſt among the Romans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

in a place appointed by Rome, environed about with huge and ſtrong walls. Here all kinds of paſtime and ſports were uſed, running with horſes, and fighting on horſeback in the one end; In the middeſt the Champions were placed in arms to fight on foot; In the other end, wraſtlers, leapers, runners, and ſuch like games were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; ſo that the place was framed accordingly long and large, that they might have room enough in both ends, and in the middeſt.</p>
               <p>This was the chief and the moſt ancient play among the Romans, ſaving <hi>Saturnalia.</hi> This ſport did <hi>Janus</hi> invent, who did reign together with <hi>Saturn,</hi> as <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſaith in the memory and monument of <hi>Saturn</hi> his fellow. This play was celebrated in the moneth of December, with ſuch mirth, pleaſure, and paſtime, that it far ſurmounted all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this moneth of December, every man ſaluted his friend with rewards tokens, preſents, or with any treaſure that they had, to pleaſure one another. And becauſe all things were common in the time of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Golden World there was ſuch mirth uſed, as would make ſome men of this time jealous to ſee it; I beleeve no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of this Age would be content to ſee his ſervant in bed with his wife, which in <hi>Saturn</hi>'s time was tolerable. Some ſay this play ſprung firſt among the Pelagians, ſome again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that it began among the Athenians; but how and where it began in other countreys it is no matter, but in Rome it was firſt framed and invented by <hi>Janus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth play amongſt the Romans was called <hi>Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> where the youth of Rome came to learn how to behave themſelves among the enemies. In this play they did fight one with another at the long Spear, the long Sword, the Staff, and ſuch weapons as then they uſed in fight, for to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden themſelves: In this play, being naked, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms, they came to fight againſt their armed enemies. By this play were the Romans taught boldly to fight with their enemies, and being hardened at home, did little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem wounds and blows abroad. Thus games and plays
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107135:108"/>
were chiefly eſtéemed of the Romans, who, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Offices affirmeth, had divers others in <hi>Martius</hi> field, hard by Rome, to exerciſe the young men to practiſe feats of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, to become ready and prompt in martial affairs, which they onely moſt eſteemed.</p>

But I will omit to ſpeak further of that, and will return to that which I mean a little to diſcuſſe. I will not ſpeak of the love and affection of man in general, but of the love mutual betwixt man and wife, betwixt brother and bro-brother. And as it is a vertue not to be forgotten, ſo is it a vertue moſt rare to find, for every thing in its own kind is moſt to be accepted, and firſt to entreat of the excéeding love, of the wonderfull affection that men bare towards their wives.</p>
               <p>We read of that noble Roman <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo well his wife <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that when ſhe died, he cauſed her picture to be made, and to be ſet up before his face in his bed chamber, to eaſe ſome part of his grief with the ſight thereof. <hi>M.

The like we read of two young men in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> the one named <hi>Aemilius,</hi> the other <hi>Cianippus,</hi> who for méer affection and paſſing love towards their wives, after long torments pangs and pains conceived by inward griefs that their wives were dead, did offer their pined bodies a ſacrifice unto death, for a pledge of their true and faithfull love. What means doth love ſéek to ſave it ſelf, and to be acquainted with eaſe and pleaſure, how carefully the Greek Poet <hi>Antimachus</hi> bewailed the death of his wife <hi>Liſidides,</hi> in ſuch mourning verſes and wofull plaints that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did read them he would be as ready to weep in reading the dolefull Epitaph of <hi>Liſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107135:109"/>
his wife, being a noble Captain of Athens, and he was withal ſo chaſt, that when <hi>Sophocles</hi> eſpied a marvellous beautifull young maid, ſaying, Behold a paſſing fair young maid, <hi>Pericles</hi> anſwered and ſaid, Not onely the heart and the hands of a Magiſtrate muſt be chaſt, but alſo his eys muſt refuſe the ſight of any but his wife. It is read, that <hi>Pericles</hi> being at Athens, he was found kiſſing and making much of his wife, and being from Athens, he was found as ſad to depart from his wife, as he was willing to die for his countrey. <hi>Orpheus</hi> loved ſo well his wife <hi>Euridice,</hi> that as the Poets feign, he feared not the power of King <hi>Pluto,</hi> to redéem his wife, with hazard and danger of his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Innumerable are they that deſerve the like fame, ſo that theſe few may be a ſufficent proof of others And now I will produce a few examples to prove the like good will and love from the wives ſhewed toward their husbands, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you heard the great love of husbands towards their wives. <hi>Alceſtes,</hi> a noble Qu. of Theſſaly, at what time K. <hi>Admetus</hi> her husband ſhould die, having received an anſwer by an Oracle, that if any would die for the King he ſhould live; which when all refuſed, his wife Queen <hi>Alceſtes</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her ſelf to die to ſave her husbands life. <hi>Julia</hi> the wife oi <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, and onely daughter to that famous and renowned <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> Emperour of Rome, was no leſſe obedient to her father <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then ſhe was loving to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Pompey,</hi> who though they both were enemies one to to another, yet ſhe ſhewed her ſelf a loving daughter unto her father, and a true wife to her husband and ſo true, that when ſhe ſaw her own <hi>Pompey</hi> coming bloudy from the field, as his apparel made a ſhew a great way off, ſhe ſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her husband was hurt, being great with child did ſtraight fall into travel, and died before <hi>Pompey</hi> had yet come in.</p>
               <p>The love of <hi>Artemiſia</hi> Quéen of Caria towards her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band King Mauſolus is as well declared by the ſumptuous Tomb. and gorgeous Grave, which ſhe made for him when he died, counted for the excellency thereof, to be one of the ſeven wonders of the world; it was alſo truly verified by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107135:109"/>
ceremonies at his death, in making the ſcull of his head her drinking cup, in drinking all the aſhes of his body as ſugar to her wine, and in knitting of his heart to her body, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Though our bodies be parted, yet our hearts ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſunder.</p>
               <p>That noble Greek <hi>Laodamia</hi> loved her husband ſo well, that when ſhe heard that her husband <hi>Proteſilaus</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Hector</hi> at the ſiege of Troy, ſhe deſired onely of God, that ſhe might ſee his ſhadow or likeneſſe once before ſhe died; which when ſhe ſaw, embracing the likeneſſe of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as ſhe thought, in her arms, ſhe then preſently died.</p>
               <p>We read that Quéen <hi>Ipſicratea</hi> loved her husband King <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſo entirely, that ſhe ſhaved off all the hairs of her head, and did wear mans apparel, and followed him like a Lackey, for that he ſhould not know her to be his wife; ſhe had rather go to the wars with her husband like a Lackey, then tarry from her husband in <hi>Pontus</hi> like a Quéen. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> when ſhe heard that her husband <hi>Seneca</hi> was put to death by that cruel Emperour and Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> whom <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> ſometime taught in his youth, but was at length requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with death; when (I ſay) <hi>Paulina</hi> heard thereof, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what kind of death her husband ſuffered, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, ſhe attempted to die the ſame kind of death her ſelf as <hi>Seneca</hi> her husband.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that noble <hi>Portia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Cato,</hi> and wife to <hi>Brutus,</hi> hearing that her husband was ſlain at Phillipi, for that ſhe could not procure a knife, ſhe choaked her ſelf with coals. The like Hiſtory is read of <hi>Triata,</hi> who when ſhe knew by letters that her husband <hi>Vitellius</hi> was environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his enemies, and no way able to eſcape, his wife ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Camp, and preaſt near her husband, ready to die or to live in the field with him.</p>
               <p>What can be ſo hard to take in hand, but love will hazard it? What can be ſo perilous, but love will venter it? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther water can ſtay it, nor fire ſtop it. <hi>Sulpitia</hi> the wife of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> the daughter of that worthy Roman <hi>Paterculus,</hi> when ſhe perceived that her husband was appointed by the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107135:110"/>
Magiſtrates of Rome to paſſe unto Sicilia as an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and there to continue for a ſeaſon though her mother had great charge over her, and very carefull and ſtudious ſhe was to comfort her daughter in the abſence of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; yet ſhe deceived her mother, ſhe changed her appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and cauſed her two maids likewiſe to be diſguiſed, and went all by night from Rome to Sicily, <hi>Aemilia</hi> the wife of <hi>Affricanus,</hi> and mother to the noble <hi>Cornelia,</hi> who was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thoſe famous Romans called <hi>Gracchi,</hi> perceiving her husband to be in love with one of her maids in the houſe, and often to uſe the maid as his wife, though <hi>Aemilia</hi> knew well of it yet ſhe never hated the maid, nor opened it unto her husband; But after that her husband was dead ſhe gave unto this Maid a great ſumme of money, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her wealthily in Rome: A rare thing to be found in a woman.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſpeak of the love of <hi>Penelope</hi> in Gréece, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her husband <hi>Ulyſſes?</hi> or ſhew the conſtancy of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creece</hi> in Rome, towards her husband <hi>Collatine?</hi> the one twenty years was proved by divers noble Greeks, yet ſhe remained true unto <hi>Uliſſes;</hi> the other through force being raviſhed by proud <hi>Tarquinius</hi> ſon named <hi>Sextus,</hi> would not be falſe to <hi>Collatinus,</hi> but opened the ſame, and revenged it with her own death. Now again how well did Queen <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miris</hi> love her ſon <hi>Margapites,</hi> the death of great <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of Perſia with two hundred thouſand of his ſouldiers can teſtifie: or how <hi>Aegeus</hi> loved his ſon <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who when he had perceived the black ſail, he ſuppoſing his ſon was ſlain, in that Labyrinth, he threw himſelf from a high rock into the ſea. Why ſhould I moleſt the Reader herein ſince an end can hardly be found? I will but onely recite one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Hiſtory out of <hi>Valerius,</hi> of a ſervant to one named <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopion,</hi> who hearing that certain ſouldiers came to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reatina in purpoſe to kill his maſter, he changed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel with his maſter, and conveyed his maſter firſt away ſafe from the enemies, and he went unto his maſters bed, as though he had béen <hi>Panopion,</hi> and ſuffered himſelf to be ſlain
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107135:110"/>
in ſtead of his maſter. A man would think, that greater love could be found in no man, then for a man to die for his friend, and truth it is: But to find ſuch love in beaſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, is wonderfull indéed; Inſomuch, that in <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi> a Peacock loved a young Virgin ſo well, that when ſhe died the Peacock alſo died. And <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that in the City of Seſton an Eagle being brought up by a young maid, loved the maid ſo well, that it would fly abroad, and kill fowls, and bring them home to the young maid; and when the Virgin died, the Eagle flew into that ſame fire where the maid was appointed to have her dead body burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and alſo died with her.</p>
               <p>The Perſians were wont for favour and affection they baro unto their horſes, to bury them; and the people na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Moloſſi made brave Sepulchres for their dogs. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great made a tomb for his horſe <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> ſo did <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> likewiſe. Such love and faithfull truſt was found in dogs, that the great King <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> of Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia never went to bed, but had a doſen great dogs in his chamber, as his guard to kéep and watch him from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for ſure he was that money might not corrupt them, friendſhip might not allure them, and threatnings might not fear them. There was a Dog in Athens named <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> unto whom the tuition of the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> was committed, with all the wealth and treaſure therein, which in the night being trained away, the Temple was robbed, the ſubſtance and the riches was ſtoln thence, but in the morning the dog found out the falſhood thereof, and made all Athens privy of the theeves, by raving and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward them.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Plini</hi> of <hi>Uliſſes</hi> dog, which <hi>Uliſſes</hi> left at home when he went with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to Phrygia to the wars of Troy, and being twenty years abſent, he found <hi>Penelope</hi> his wife and his dog faithfull and loving at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. That noble Gréek <hi>Liſimachus</hi> had a dog named <hi>Duri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> that loved him ſo well, that even at <hi>Liſimachus</hi> death, the dog died alſo. <hi>Hiero</hi> had another dog that died even ſo,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107135:111"/>
and ran willingly unto that flame of fire where his maſter did burn, to die with him. I might well ſpeak of <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> dog, which whereſoever he came, no man might or durſt ſpeak any evill of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in preſence of his dog. <hi>Titus Sabinus</hi> dog never forſook his maſter in priſon, and when any man gave him bread or meat, he brought it to his maſter in priſon, and when he was thrown into the river Tiber, the dog was ſéen, as <hi>Fulgotius</hi> ſaith, to do what he could to lift up his maſters head out of the water, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his maſter had béen alive.</p>
               <p>At what time <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſubdued the City of Argos, there was in thoſe wars an Elephant which after he perceived that his maſter was ſlain, went up and down among the dead ſouldiers to ſeek his maſter; which being found dead, the Elephant brought his body being dead to a ſafe place, where the Elephant after much mourning died for ſorrow. The like examples we read in <hi>Plini</hi> of horſes, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thrée, the one <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, King of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia had; the ſecond <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> Emperour of Rome poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the third <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of Syria had: theſe thrée hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuffered no man to ride or touch them, but their own maſter, and were ſo gentle to them, that they kneeled to let them mount on their backs. Thus beaſts did bear fancy to men, obey and love them, and were moſt true and truſty to men, and did ſhew ſuch love, as neither <hi>Seleucus</hi> to his ſon <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107135:111"/>
the fields, fouls of the ayr, and fiſhes of the Seas, all things made to fear and to love him, and yet he neither to fear God nor to love himſelf. We read in <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> of an Elephant that King <hi>Potus</hi> of India had, which <hi>Alexander</hi> the great took captive afterward, when this Elephant ſaw the King firſt, he knéeled down and ſhewed ſuch honour and homage as was marvellous to the beholders. It is read in <hi>Caelius,</hi> of a King in Egypt named <hi>Merthes,</hi> that had a Crow taught to carry his letters, and how to bring anſwer in writing home again. <hi>Plini</hi> doth write that a Nightingale loved <hi>Steſicorus</hi> ſo well, that it would alwaies ſing at the beck of <hi>Steſicorus</hi> to pleaſure him. <hi>Heraclides</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher had a Dragon taught to follow him every where. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jax</hi> likewiſe had in Locreſia a Serpent brought up and taught to honour him as his maſter. <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Empreſs and wife unto <hi>Claudian,</hi> had a Thruſh that never departed from her during the Empreſſe life. <hi>Plini</hi> hath in his book of natural hiſtories infinit ſuch exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples to prove the love that all moving creatures do ow &amp; ſhew to man: as the wild Bull in Tarentum, the raging bear in Daunia, which <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> ſo tamed, that all places, all countries, and all perſons, were ſure and ſafe from any danger or hurt by theſe wild beaſts. This commeth by no vertue that is in man but onely by that which God made for man, that all living creatures fear man and love man; ſo that if compariſons be made, it ſhall be evident that there hath béen more love in beaſts towards man, then in man towards man: yea, then brother to brother, then the husband toward the wife, or the wife toward her huband, conſidering the nature of man and the beaſt together.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome hold opinion, that in the ancient time whiles yet the world flouriſhed not in learning, that memory then was moſt ſet by and eſtéemed; for whatſoever was ſéen or heard, was then committed to memory, and not recorded in books. But <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, after the uſe of letters were had, the vertue of memory decayed, for that care which then was by tradition and memory, with care and diligence to obſerve, is now by all put in books, that now our memory is put in writing, and then was it fixed in mind: inſomuch that the noble Athenian <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> paſſing by <hi>Simonides</hi> ſchool, who as ſome ſuppoſe taught firſt the Art of memory, being demanded whether he would learn the art and faculty of memory, anſwered, that he had rather learn how to forget things, then to kéep things in memory, for I cannot ſaid he, forget what I would, and I have things in memory, which feign I would they were out of memory. <hi>Seneca</hi> doth ſo report of himſelf; that he was of ſuch a perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that he could rehearſe after one, by hearing, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred verſes: yea to a greater marvell of his memory, he could recite two thouſand names of men, being repeated once before him, with as good a memory as he that firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them. The like we read of <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> a Captain, that having a great army of ſouldiers under him, if any were abſent in any place about any buſineſſe, he had in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the name of the perſon, the name of the place, and the cauſe of the buſineſſe. Of this excellent memory, to their perpetuall fame was King <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> the one a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian the other a Roman, which had this fame by memory, that either of them could ſeverally call their ſouldiers by name, every one after another, which is moſt rare, yea moſt marvellous, having ſo many alwaies under them, as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107135:112"/>
both Rome and Perſia were chiefly in their days by them defended, to be able to name ſo many ſouldiers, as either of them both had in their armies. Their memory was ſuch then that they may not be forgotten now: <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was much renowned, for that <hi>Pliny</hi> reported, that he could do ſuch things by memory, as in reading, in talking, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in anſwering at one time, that no fault could be found in either of theſe four qualities at one time practiſed, whereby he deſerveth no leſſe praiſe by his memory, then fame by his acts. Divers excelled in time paſt in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>Hortenſius</hi> a noble Oratour of Rome, was able to ſpeak in any place, any thing which he premeditated pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, without ſtudy openly, he had more truſt in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory then in books. <hi>Carmides</hi> of Greece was ſo famous for that faculty, that he never heard any reading, but he could repeat it word by word without writing, were the writing or reading never ſo long, he would not miſſe a ſyllable. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> a noble and a famous Oratour, one of the counſellours of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> being ſent from Epire unto the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Rome as an Embaſſadour, he but once hearing the names of the Senatours, before he came unto the Senate houſe, he named them orderly by name, every one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that all the Senatours were in a great admiration of his memory, in repeating ſo many names in opening ſo many matters, in concluding ſo many things: which when he came unto King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> he recited not onely his doings and orations, but alſo their anſwers and replies, every word by word, as then was ſpoken, done, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Senatours. This <hi>Cineas</hi> was not ſo excellent of memory, but alſo of paſſing eloquence of whom King <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> was wont to ſay, that he got more Cities, Towns and Kingdomes by the eloquence of <hi>Cineas,</hi> then with all the force and ſtrength of the Epirots beſide. It is written in <hi>Laertius</hi> in his eighth book, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had charge of God <hi>Mercury,</hi> to ask what he would (ſaving immortality) and he ſhould have have it, and he willed to keep in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all things that he heard, and ſaw and to forget nothing

A ſtrange thing it is now to find a man in this our ripe years, that can ſpeak half a dozen languages. If a man can but ſmatter in ſix or ſeven languages, he is noted to be a rare fellow, and yet King <hi>Mithridates</hi> had xxii. A note of great memory; for ſome there be in learning for one language, that they hardly know, they forget another that they know. That worthy man <hi>Lucullus</hi> is remembred of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his fourth book of Academical queſtions, for his paſſing and noble memory. The Egyptians uſed notes and figures for their memory, inſomuch that they noted the well memoried man with a For or a Hare, for that the Hare heareth beſt, and the For is of greateſt memory: and if any wanted memory, they compared him to the Crocodile. We read of <hi>Eſdras</hi> a Prieſt, that he had all the laws of the Hebrews upon his finger end. We read of <hi>Portius</hi> that he never forgot any thing, that he once read before. He again, would never read that, which once he wrot, but ſtraight out of hand, his memory was ſuch, he would ſpeak it and pronounce it in order even as he wrote it before. Memory therefore is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Net, which taketh and ſtayeth great fiſh, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth through the little fiſh; and even as books that be not occupied wax ruſty, and did cleave together, ſo memory,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107135:113"/>
that is not occupied, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> waxeth dull, and oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as we oftentimes ſee how forgetfull men wax, either with ſickneſſe, age, or ſuch like, that letteth the memory of man: as <hi>Orbilius</hi> by extremity of age forgot his Alphabets and letters: <hi>Hermolaus</hi> had a friend, which in his youth was a perfect Grecian, and yet in his latter years waxed ſo oblivious, that he could not read Gréek. <hi>Plini</hi> ſaith <hi>Meſſala</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Corvius</hi> waxed ſo forgetfull by long ſickneſſe, that he forgot his own name. And <hi>Seneca</hi> doth write of one <hi>Calviſius,</hi> that was ſo weak of memory, that he did forget the names of thoſe, that he was daily in company with, as <hi>Achilles, Uliſſes,</hi> and <hi>Priamus</hi> whom he knew very well. What is it elſe for a man to want memory, but to want the name of his knowne friend, for hee is no man that knoweth not that man: as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> ſometime Emperour of Rome, his beadel having forgot when he ſhould come unto the Senate, demanded of the Emperour whether he would command him to do any thing that he could do? why ſaid the Emperour, take this letter with thee, that men may know thée, for thou knoweſt no man, for thou wanteſt memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> doth make mention of <hi>Curio,</hi> that was ſo oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being a judge, that he forgot the cauſe, which he ſhould give judgement upon. Likewiſe <hi>Articus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sophiſta</hi> was of ſo frail memory, that he could never keep in mind, the names of the four Elements. <hi>Bamba</hi> a certain King of the Goths, by a draught of drink given by <hi>Heringeus</hi> his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour loſt his memory. It may well be that drink cutteth off memory. For the Poets fain that there is a river na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lethes,</hi> whoſe water if any man taſte thereof, he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any thing done or paſt before. In this were the Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſo dull of memory, that they could not count above the number of four. Now that memory is praiſed in ſome, and obliviouſneſſe is diſpraiſed in others, there vvant no teſtimonies therein vvhat may be ſpoken of thoſe that vvere counted famous clerks, and the renovvnedſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours in all the vvorld, vvhich did not onely ſtay in their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107135:114"/>
Orations, but alſo were quite beſide their matters? as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes Cicero,</hi> two noble Oratours upon whom depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City of Athens and Rome, ſuch imperfection was in them, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was ſo diſmaied at the preſence of <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, and <hi>Cicero</hi> ſo aſtonied at the preſence of ſome bold Senators, that both tongue and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance failed theſe noble Orators.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> that grave Philoſopher who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> many times was put to ſilence in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his Oration, before the people of Athens. So was <hi>Heraclitus Severus</hi> dumb before the Emperour, <hi>Herodus At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> was before <hi>M. Antonius;</hi> ſo that the preſence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the dignity of places, the majeſty of ſtates, abate and change the worthineſſe of the perſon. Some again chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves that which altogether they are in no capacity to apprehend, as <hi>Hyparchion,</hi> who when he would have contended with <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> had not a word to ſpeak, in ſomuch that a proverb grew thereon, applied unto him that is more talkative then wiſe, <hi>Hiparchion <hi>is dumb.</hi>
                  </hi> Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with <hi>Caſſius Severus,</hi> who though all his books were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Senatours, ſaid that he carried all his learning in mind and memory, which could not be taken away. For my learning, ſaid he, is in my mind, and not printed in books.</p>
               <p>The greateſt excellency that can be in man is memory, and the next thing that approacheth immortality is memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. and ſo nigh, that if a man could but remember the end of the things, he ſhould never taſte death, but he ſhould live for ever.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Cynick Philoſopher <hi>Diogenes,</hi> making himſelf ignorant ſometime in that which he knew beſt, was wont in banquets and feaſts to ſay, if any man had demanded what kind of meat there was, I cannot name it, but I can eat it; and ſo would paſſe to anſwer any thing with diſſimulations. So likewiſe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour would ſay, that he that could not diſſemble, could not rule. At what time <hi>Galba,</hi> a Citizen of Rome, had bidden a Gentleman named <hi>Mecaenas</hi> unto ſupper, perceiving the Gentleman to be in love with his wife, he feigned himſelf aſléep, for that <hi>Mecaenas</hi> might ſhew ſome part of his will, and love in the mean ſeaſon: In the mean time, while his wife and he were in talk, came one of his ſervants, to take ſome things away from the table, ſuppoſing his maſter had béen aſléep; unto whom his maſter ſaid, Sirrah forbear, though I ſée not <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> yet I ſée you; I ſléep to him, and not to you.</p>
               <p>The like diſſimulation was betwéen <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Archia,</hi> at what time he fled from Athens for fear of <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> diſpleaſure, and went to the Iſle of Calabria, where in the Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> he hid himſelf, till <hi>Archias</hi> came, and promiſed him what honour and dignity he could enjoy, if he would come unto <hi>Antipater: Demoſthenes</hi> perceiving his diſſimulations, and crafty ways, anſwered plainly, to move him to anger, and ſaid, Thou of all men couldeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver play upon the ſtage, playing thy part then where truth is oftentimes opened, and now at this time, thou canſt not be an Orator to perſwade me: whereat <hi>Archias</hi> waxed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and threatned to hale him out of the Temple; to whom <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> anſwered, Now perforce thy diſſimulation is broke forth into truth.</p>
               <p>I might hereon ſtay, to note the great diſſimulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107135:115"/>
                  <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> which was ſo great, that <hi>Metellus</hi> feigned that Rome was happy that <hi>Scipio</hi> was born therein, and yet was his mortal enemy all the days of his life. In like caſe <hi>Frederick,</hi> an Emperor ſometime of Rome, at what time the Senators would ſit about the ſtate of the City, he would ſay, Before you go into the Senate houſe, caſt away from you two things that you carry with you: And being demanded of the Senate, what two things were they, he ſaid, Simulations, and Diſſmulations.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon differed much from his ſon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Alexander</hi> would exerciſe nothing but magnanimity and truth; and his father uſed all kind of falſhood, as was ſéen by ſubduing of the Sarunſians, and the Cities of Thrace; for under colour of peace, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſouldiers to bring under their Clokes, every one a cord, that at what time King <hi>Philip</hi> made ſilence to ſpeak, the enemies being attentive to hear, he ſtretched forth his right hand, for a Watch-word to his ſouldiers, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to bind the enemies with their cords, and to bring them captive to Macedonia. The like craft uſed <hi>Alcibiades</hi> amongſt the Agrigentines, feigning that he had ſomething to ſpeak for the common profit, as well of Athens, as of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grigentum, calling them into place as though he would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſomething neceſſary for them, and had the Gréeks rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the mean time to take the City, and to poſſeſſe their ſubſtance by this craft.</p>
               <p>Such craft uſed <hi>Thraſillus,</hi> to take the City of Byzanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; ſuch deceit uſed <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> to overcome Babylon; ſuch did <hi>Sextus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> practiſe againſt the Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who when he perceived that his father might by no means ſubdue them, he imitated <hi>Zopyrus</hi> craft, making the enemies to believe that he was ill handled, and cruelly uſed by his father, and that he knew well how to deceive his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to betray him unto them, they being ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Sextus,</hi> made him chief of their company: He ſtraight ſent meſſengers to his father, to ſignifie unto him, that he might do his pleaſure with his enemies. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

the craft and ſubtilty of his ſon, did bring the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger into a fair garden, miſtruſting (like a wiſe Prince) the matter, and gave this ſubtil warning to his ſon; Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up and down the Garden with divers noble man, he with his ſtaff did ſtrike off the chief flowers in the Garden, ſaying to the meſſenger, Farewel, tell my ſon what I do, and bid him do accordingly. Young <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his fathers mind, flew the moſt eminent of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and having thus oppreſſed the chief men, he betrayed the City to his Father.</p>
               <p>By this means, and like craft, <hi>Conon</hi> the Athenian decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Perſians in Cyprus. The ſubtilty that <hi>Pyſiſtratus</hi> uſed, to beguile the people of Megaera, &amp; what <hi>Hannibal</hi> uſed in Italy, when he ſubdued Tarentum, are to like effect; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was wont to ſay when the Romans had again won Tarentum, <hi>Eadem arte qua prius cepimus, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum amiſimus:</hi> For by craft <hi>Hannibal</hi> vanquiſhed the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines, and by craft did the Romans win the ſame again. <hi>Antigonus</hi> deceived the Citizens of Corinth, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a marriage betwixt his ſon <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> wife, who then was a widdow, and a Quéen in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; for in the midſt of triumphs, and preparations to the marriage, <hi>Antigonus</hi> by deceit took the Caſtle, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſouldiers in arms, and proclaimed himſelf King in Corinth.</p>
               <p>In the ſame book of <hi>Polinaeus,</hi> the like Hiſtory is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Lyſander</hi> of Sparta, and <hi>Nearchus</hi> of Creet, the one promiſing to the inhabitants of Miletum, his aid and help, in defending their liberties, and the people giving credit to a Kings promiſe, and truſting to have <hi>Lyſander</hi> their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial friend, they found him their mortal foe; for he decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them thereby, and took the City of Miletum unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The other ſailing to the haven of Telmeſſus to renue friendſhip with <hi>Antripatridas,</hi> who then governed the City of Telmeſſus, under the color of friendſhip, he had his men at arms ready on the Sea, to deſtroy his friend, and to take the City to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:107135:116"/>This deceit was not onely ſéen in wars, where much falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and perjury is practiſed, but in all things men uſe craft, according to the proverb, <hi>There is craft in daubing.</hi> To ſpeak of <hi>Theodectes</hi> craft toward his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to defraud him privily of his glory; to ſpeak of <hi>Sertorius</hi> deceit, in winning authority among the common people; to deſcribe the means that <hi>Dioniſius</hi> uſed to get mony amongſt the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſans; or how <hi>Pythius</hi> deceived <hi>Cannius</hi> in his bargain of fiſh; or how <hi>Darius</hi> became King of Perſia by the neighing of a Mare, and a million more of ſuch deceits and crafts, were infinite. I therefore refer the Reader to <hi>Poliaenus,</hi> where he ſhall have enough of falſhood. But becauſe craft is uſed diverſly, I will ſomewhat touch thoſe that uſed craft, in altering themſelves into the form of women, ſome for filthy luſt, ſome for vertues ſake, and ſome for vice.</p>
               <p>What kind of diſſimulation was in <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> King of Aſſyria, to forſake the Empire to forgo his Kingdome, to become like a woman to ſpin and card with his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, and ſo from the ſhape of a man to diſſemble himſelf to be a woman? What kind of diſſimulation did that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and mighty <hi>Hercules,</hi> even the off-ſpring of the Gods, and ſon to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> uſe, after that he tamed monſters, ſlew Giants, overcame Dragons, Lions, wild beaſts, and yet he did tranſlate himſelf from a champion and a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into womans apparel, and faſhioned himſelf like a woman: with ſuch diſſimulation he ſerved <hi>Omphale</hi> Quéen of Lydia like a woman, in the apparel of a woman, at the whéel and at the cards at <hi>Omphales</hi> commandement. What kind of craft uſed <hi>Clodius,</hi> to bring his purpoſe to paſs with <hi>Pompeia, Caeſars</hi> wife, diſſembling himſelf to be a woman, as <hi>Cicero</hi> taunteth him in an Epiſtle that he writeth to <hi>Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> where he ſaith, that <hi>Clodius</hi> diſſembled with the Npmph <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> as he was wont to uſe the thrée ſiſters. Thus <hi>Clodius</hi> would at all times go unto <hi>Pompeia,</hi> in the apparel of a woman to uſe ſuch feats, that he made <hi>Caeſar</hi> to divorce his wife <hi>Pompeia.</hi>

There <hi>Achilles</hi> was a long while, at the commandement of his mother <hi>Thetis,</hi> untill the Oracle was given that the City of Troy ſhould never be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the help of <hi>Achilles, Uliſſes</hi> being moſt ſubtill and crafty, taking upon him to ſéek out <hi>Achilles,</hi> took a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pack full of fine wares, ſuch as women buy and a ſtrong bow and arrows: thus when <hi>Uliſſes</hi> came to King <hi>Lyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> daughters, though he knew <hi>Achilles</hi> to be there, yet becauſe he was in the apparel of a woman he knew him not, and therefore ſhewed his fine ware unto the Kings daughters, having a ſtrong bow bent by him: while <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damia</hi> the mother of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and the reſt of her ſiſters, viewed the gliſtering ware of <hi>Uliſſes, Achilles</hi> ſtept in, and took <hi>Uliſſes</hi> bow in hand, and drew it, whereby <hi>Uliſſes</hi> ſéeing him draw ſo ſtrong a bow, he ſtraight perceived, that he was <hi>Achilles.</hi> And thus one craft beguileth another, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit deceiveth another, and one diſſembling man findeth out another.

               <p>What maketh any meat ſwéet? hunger. What cauſeth man to féed pleaſantly? hunger. Or what makes any drink
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107135:118"/>
pleaſant thirſt? For at what time <hi>Darius</hi> was enforced of méer thirſt to drink of a lake, all defiled with ſtinking car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes of dead ſouldiers being then in the field and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to take his flight, he ſaid after his draught, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drank ſwéeter drink in his life. Though this King was a proud Prince over the Perſians, and had all kind of wines at commandement, yet his want and penury now, and his thirſty ſtomack, was the onely cauſe of this noble drink which he ſo much commended and preferred before all the wine that ever he drank before. Even ſo affirmed King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in his wars, when his victuals, and all were ſpoiled by the enemies, of a few dry figs, and of a piece of a barley loaf upon which he fel ſo hungerly, that he ſpake after this ſort: O good Lord, of how great a pleaſure have I béen all this while ignorant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liſimachus</hi> likewiſe being in wars in Thracia, againſt <hi>Domitianus</hi> the Emperour, where he and all his ſouldiers were kept ſo long without drink, untill he was ſo thirſty, that he was inforced with all his hoſt to yeeld as captives to the Emperour <hi>Domitianus,</hi> and now being in captivity, having a draught of drink of the Emperour, he ſaid: O God that I ſhould make my ſelf from a King to be a captive, from a noble Prince of Greece, to be a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave unto the Romans, for one draught of drink? See what hunger and thirſt is: how it hath made Kings to yeeld, and Princes to be vanquiſhed. Yea it hath made King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in his own Kingdome of Egypt, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a piece of bread which was given him in a poor Cottage, and to ſay that he never eat better meat, nor more comfortable chear in all his life, then that piece of bread was.</p>
               <p>It was the cuſtome of that noble Emperor <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> in all his wars, more with famine, then with ſword, to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his enemies. For this famous warriour would often ſay, that even as the phyſitian would uſe his patients, ſo would he his enemies; the rule of the phyſitian is, to make his patient faſt to recover his health, The order of <hi>Caeſar</hi>

was, to kéep the enemy from victual, to make them yéeld. Great is the force of Famine: And by Hiſtories we read, that when King <hi>Cambyſes</hi> marched towards the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he endured great ſcarcity of victuals, and ſuch penury and want of food was among the ſouldiers, that they agréed with themſelves to kill the tenth throughout all the hoſt, to aſſwage hunger; and the Famine continued ſo long, that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the King was in great fear, leſt the Lot ſhould at length happen upon him and ſo to be eaten of his own ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>Sagunthus a City in Spain, as <hi>Eutropius</hi> doth witneſſe, in great amity with the Romans, was beſieged by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians ſo long, that all the City was brought unto ſuch famine, that the Lords and the Captains of the City made a great fire in the Market place, and there brought all their wealth and ſubſtance, and threw it into the fire, and after made their Wives and their Children to enter into the fire, and laſt of all, the chief Lords and Captains, ended their own lives in it leſt they ſhould come into the enemies hand: So great was that Famine, that it was before prognoſticated by a Woman in the time of her delivery, whoſe child, his head being out, entred into his Mothers womb again.</p>
               <p>The like calamity happened in Caligurium, a City where <hi>Quintilian</hi> was born, which being likewiſe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>Cneius Pompey,</hi> to bring them in ſubjection, and to kéep promiſe with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> they lacked victuals, and waxed ſo hungry, that all kind of beaſts whatſoever being ſlain, they were conſtrained to eat their own Wives and Children. It was ſéen in Ieruſalem, when that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> the Emperor of Rome, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were compelled to eat their own children, for very hunger, whoſe ſmall and tender bones were left as a ſhew and token of their calamity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> in his eighth book of Natural Hiſtories, ſaith, that when <hi>Hannibal</hi> laid ſiege to the city Caſilinum, the Roman
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107135:119"/>
ſouldiers were in ſuch hunger, that one Mouſe was ſold for two hundred pieces of ſilver, and he that ſold the Mouſe, died himſelf for hunger. The Athenians likewiſe were brought unto ſuch hunger by <hi>Sylla,</hi> who afterward was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of Rome, that one buſhel of Wheat was ſold amongſt the ſouldiers for a thouſand Drachmes; the common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being poor, for want of money on the one ſide, and ſore plagued with hunger on the other, were compelled to eat the gréen graſſe of the fields about the City of Athens, and to gather the moſſe off the walls of the City, and did eat it: This City of Athens was oftentimes brought to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, as by King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> by King <hi>Philip,</hi> and by his ſon <hi>Alexander</hi> the great.</p>
               <p>So much was famine feared amongſt the ancient Gréeks, that in the time of abundance they uſed to ſcourge famine with rods out of their houſes, ſaying, <hi>For as fames, intra di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiae;</hi> Away penury, come in plenty. We read in <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> was driven by hunger to eat his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and Elephants, and other huge beaſts that carried the trains for the wars. Such hunger and famine did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen among the Lacedemonians, that the Citizens of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta were ſo hungry, that they did eat the very ſerpents that had béen dead a long while, which multitude of ſerpents did preſage this great calamity to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though they had been dead a long time, yet the Spartans moſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly did feed on them, and mitigated the rage of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doda</hi> King of Syria beſieged a great and famous City in Iewry, called <hi>Iora,</hi> where the miſerable mothers were by meer hunger enforced to féed on the bowels of their own children. Not much unlike was that horrible and cruel fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the countrey of Apulia, where the ſouldiers being enforced by the French men, then their enemies in War, were compelled to take the skins from their Bucklers, and to warm and boil the hard horns, and to eat them. To ſpeak of the wonderfull calamity, miſeries, and plagues that happened through hunger, the charge thereof were
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107135:119"/>
too much; too many authorities are manifeſt in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. <hi>Antonius,</hi> whom <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> could never vanquiſh by force of arms, was driven to yeeld in a City called Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſia, by hunger and famine. Wherefore that noble Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, <hi>Nicias,</hi> always thought the eaſieſt way of conqueſt was by Famine, which he ſhewed at Melos, a City of Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly, where he made the Citizens to yeeld by hunger. O raging force of famine! O terrible miſery of man! which compelleth the parents to eat the children, the children to kill their parents: what beaſt was ſpared ever, when this hapned? The people named <hi>Hymmi,</hi> through hunger were conſtrained to eat their own dogs, as the Macedonians did ſometime feed themſelves with Camels, Elephants, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>What herb was unſought? What root was not found to feed this cruel Monſter? <hi>Sabellicus</hi> doth witneſſe of a dearth that chanced in his time, that in ſome parts of the countrey of Flaminia, and about the fields Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eni, the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did live by graſſe and herbs, and by ſuch like that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the earth. Thus was the world ever plagued with famine, as with that Monſter that ſpoileth and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelf, as we read of divers that did eat their own arms and fleſh. Again, in the ſacred ſcripture, divers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we have of the like plagues ſent from GOD to plague man. But even as hunger one way is moſt excellent if meat may be had, ſo hunger another way is moſt terrible, if meat doth fail. Therefore <hi>Stratonicus</hi> never went to bed without a cup of drink by him, not for that he thirſted when he went to bed but leſt he ſhould thirſt in the bed, and ſo be compelled to do ſome injury to one or other, for that he wanted drink. So did <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, when he ſaw the poor countrey man greedily feeding on Grapes, he ſaid, O would the Gods had framed me to be ſuch a one as this is. So that hunger is good to thoſe that want food. <hi>Gnefactus</hi> King of Egypt his ſouldiers in the deſerts of Arabia wanting victuals, waxed ſo hungry that he himſelf not amongſt the countrey men, and their homely
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107135:120"/>
fare was ſo acceptable unto him, that he ſet up a table for a Monument of the ſame, in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Thebes,</p>
               <p>Of divers Famines we read in ſcripture, as of that in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who fled from the land of Canaan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt and <hi>Iſaac</hi> was driven by famine unto <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of the Paleſtines, and all the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to go to King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> where their own brother <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ruled as chief Officer. Famine is appointed for a juſt ſcourge to ſin, as appeareth by <hi>David,</hi> who for cauſing the people to be numbred, had leave to chuſe either Plague, Famine, or Warres, which are the inſtruments to puniſh offenders.</p>

Tents, and ready to pitch the field the next day againſt the Meſſagetes, he commanded his ſouldiers to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that night, to flée from their tents; leaving behind their victuals and ſubſtance, that the enemies being buſie about the ſpoil, and given up to banquettting, and carow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of wine he with all his army might unawares return, and finding the Meſſagetes more greedy of the ſpoil, then ready for their enemies, he did deſtroy and kill them. So that in wars, ſaith <hi>Saluſt,</hi> wit doth as much good as ſtrength, policy ſometimes is better accepted then power, and <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith, ſo that victory be gotten, men weigh not whether it be through courage or through policy. For <hi>Sertorius</hi> that worthy Captain of Rome, was wont by falſe letters, by dreams and outward religion, to feign and invent a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand waies to ſtir his ſouldiers to courage. The inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wit is much, and ſo divers, that too much it were to repeat it. <hi>Sicionius</hi> deceived <hi>Xerxes</hi> with all his ſouldiers through policy. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> moved the Athenians, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his falſe wrongs upon the chief Officers of Athens. <hi>Darius</hi> after <hi>Cambiſes</hi> death became King of Perſia, by means of a horſe, and ſuch like. But letting paſſe infinite numbers of ſuch, I will declare what nature wrought in ſilly and ſimple beaſts, in flying fowls, and in the very fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſwimming in the water.</p>
               <p>The Lion by nature is taught being very ſick, to find out an Ape, which by outward ſports and paſtime, doth heal his great grief. The huge Elephant is ſo ſubtil when he is like to die, that he will ſéek by all means the Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, which he ſo eſtéemeth, that his ſickneſſe forſaketh him ſtraight. The Panther knoweth by nature his ready ſalve for his ſore, for féeling himſelf not well, he ſtreight ſéeketh the dung of man, and by the ſcent thereof, he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf. The ſtriken Hart féeding on high mountains hath that conſideration that at what time he is ſhot through with any dart or arrow, by féeding of an hearb called <hi>Dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amum,</hi> his bloud ſtencheth, and his wounds are healed. And the Bear is ſo crafty, that by the ſame nature he is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107135:121"/>
taught being ſick, to lick and eat up little ants for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed phyſick.</p>
               <p>Even ſo flying fowls do know their appointed ſalve for their ſores, being taught by nature. The Raven, the Duck, the Swallow, yea, the ſilly Mice do before hand preſage their ruinous ſtate by nature, and know well the decay of any houſe, barn, or place where they be, and will change hoſpitality before the time, if neceſſity happen upon them. The little Ants are full of toil and travell to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Summer, to ſerve them in the Winter, Of this with divers others. <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh mention in his 8. book, chapter 27. and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his book <hi>De natura ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium.</hi> We read in <hi>Aelianus</hi> divers worthy hiſtories of the like, but eſpecially of the Cranes of Sicilia, which when they be about to take their flight from Sicilia, over mount Caucaſus, they are ſo crafty and ſubtil by nature, that they bear in their mouths certain ſtones, to ſtop that cry and noiſe, which Cranes moſt commonly uſe in flight, leſt by hearing of their voice and the noiſe they make, the Eagles of Caucaſus ſhould deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>The Goats of Creet, when they be ſhot through with darts and arrows, are of themſelves moved to feed on a certain hearb; which ſtreight ſtencheth the bloud, healeth the wound, and expelleth the venome out of the wound, There is ſuch craft and ſubtilty in a little Frog of <hi>Nilus,</hi> that when the Trout commeth toward him to deſtroy him, the Frog by and by out of hand, beareth a long reed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart this mouth, and ſo marcheth forward toward this great champion, that by no means he can deſtroy him, for that the reed is longer then his mouth can ſwallow the ſame, and ſo the little Frog eſcapeth the terrour of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. What a ſleight hath a fiſh called Polipos, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to feed on any fiſh, he goeth and hideth himſelf under ſome ſhrub or rock or any other place, whereby he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be, as though he were a tile or a ſtone, till the fiſh come to that place, then he leaps on them, and kils them. So that there is no beaſt, no fowl, no fiſh, but hath as it were
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107135:121"/>
a certain priviledge by nature to defend himſelf, and to foil his foe, and by nature taught to practiſe it craftily. There is again a kind of knowledge in beaſts to know their friends, and to love them, and to fear their enemies and to avoid them. The Serpents in Terinthia, the Scorpions in Arcadia, and the Snakes in Syria, as <hi>Plini</hi> affirms, will not hurt their country men and known friends, though they find them aſléep, as divers and ſundry times hiſtories make mention thereof. Strange therefore is the work of nature, which mightily diſplaieth her ſelf in all living creatures; and for the proof thereof, I will note one hiſtory written by <hi>Quintilian</hi> in his 14. book of hiſtories, that in Achaia there was a city named Patra, in the which a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain young man bought a little dragon, which with great care and diligence he nouriſhed till it waxed big lying in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in the night time, and playing all the day time. At length the Magiſtrates of the City, fearing leſt ſome hurt ſhould be done by him, conſidering the fierce and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el nature of them, did let him to go to the wilderneſſe where divers other Dragons were. And there being a long time, this young man that brought up this dragon, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his fellows paſſing by, where this dragon was, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain théeves aſſailed them, and he by his voice was known by this dragon, which as ſoon as he heard, he came out of the den, and ſéeing him with divers of his fellows like to be murthered, he flew to the very faces of the théeves, and ſo ſtrongly fought with them, that ſome of them the dragon ſlue, ſome were ſore hurt, and ſome conſtrained to flie: thus he ſaved this young man and his fellows, in recompence of his former courteſie. Surely I think better of this dragon, then of ſome ingrateful perſons that live now in the world.</p>

               <p>We read in <hi>Bruſonius,</hi> of <hi>Dion</hi> of Alexandria, who with ſilence revenged more his foes, then with words; for being provoked to anger by a villain and abject, which followed him through the ſtréets, chiding and threatning him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not one word, but bad him Good night, when he come to his own door; which when the enemy ſaw and that he would not be moved to anger, to take any advantage on him, he went to the next tree and hanged himſelf. Thus did <hi>Socrates,</hi> who being blamed by his friends for his ſilence in that he was injuriouſly handled by his foe, anſwered That his enemies could not endamage him, ſith he was not that man whom his words did import to be; and being ſtricken &amp; ſpurned by the ſame man, <hi>Socrates</hi> was counſelled to call the ſame to the Law before the Iudges, to the which he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Which of you if an Aſſe ſtrike him, will call that Aſſe before any Iudges, ſith he is no better that uſeth me this; for by this am I known to be <hi>Socrates</hi> and he to be an Aſs.

But he, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fear, and partly for love of <hi>Phobius</hi> her husband, in no wiſe would conſent to any filthy deſire; <hi>Cleoboea, Phobius</hi> wife, took the ſame in ſo evil part, that ſhe began mortally to hate him, inventing what way beſt ſhe might revenge his diſcourteſie in refuſing her love. She feigned on a time, that ſhe had quite forgotten her old love towards him, and thanked <hi>Antheus</hi> very much for the love and great zeal that he did bear to her husband <hi>Phobius,</hi> in not conſenting to her folly then when ſhe was in love with him. Thus talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, <hi>Cleoboea</hi> brought her old Lover <hi>Antheus</hi> over a Well, where for that purpoſe onely, ſhe threw a tame Partridge, deſiring him to aid her to have her Partridge
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107135:123"/>
out of the Well; the young Gentleman miſdoubting her in nothing, as one willing to pleaſure his friend and old lover, went down into the Well to have the Partridge out, but ſhe revenged her old love, and requited his ſervice after this ſort, ſhe threw a great ſtone after him, and there killed him; and ſtraight for ſorrow caling to mind the old amity, and hidden love betwéen them, ſhe hanged her ſelf. This revenge that noble and famous Lacedemonian uſed, who had his own wife in ſuch admiration, and was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in love, that he was as much hated of her, as ſhe of him was honoured and eſtéemed. For ſhe loves King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crotatus</hi> ſon ſo dear, that her husband <hi>Cleonimus</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, went to Epire to King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> perſwading him earneſtly to go unto Peloponeſus, and to move wars againſt King <hi>Acrotatus,</hi> whereby he might revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done by his wife, in killing him whom ſhe loved beſt, thinking it a greater revenge to kill him whom ſhe loved better then her ſelf, then to revenge it upon her own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Valerius Torquatus,</hi> for that he might not have <hi>Tuſcus</hi> daughter in marriage moved wars immediately, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged the ſame with bloud.

               <p>I will not ſpeak here of ſuch revenging of Princes, of Countreys, of friends that all men know: But of rare revenge, which Philoſophy taught unto <hi>Socrates</hi> toward <hi>Xantippe;</hi> who being at ſupper, having a ſtrange gueſt, named <hi>Enthidemus,</hi> his wife <hi>Xantippe</hi> began to take her husband up, with taunting and opprobrious words, which becauſe he would not anſwer, and be moved by her chiding, ſhe overthrew the Table, with all the Meat, and the Cups: Which when <hi>Enthidemus</hi> ſaw, he was amazed at the raging of <hi>Xantippe,</hi> and beheld <hi>Socrates</hi> in the face, to ſee how he thought of the matter. But <hi>Socrates</hi> underſtanding that his gueſt did marvel at his wife, ſaid, Have not you ſometime at home a Hen that will after long clocking with a ſudden flight throw down your cups with her wing? wherewith <hi>Enthidemus</hi> was fully ſatisfied, with the wiſe anſwer of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> in not revenging ſo great a fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phocion,</hi> a learned man of Athens, was wont to ſay, That he had rather ſuffer injury wrongfully, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge injury ſometime rightfully. This man <hi>Phocion</hi> by whom Athens long flouriſhed, at what time he was put to death moſt wrongfully of the Athenians, even a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould die, being demanded whether he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing to his ſon, ſtanding hard by to ſée his fathers end, did ſpeak to his ſon after this ſort: My ſon, ſaid he, this I charge and require thée, and moreover, beſéech thée, that thou wilt never revenge the wrongfull death of thy father <hi>Phocion</hi> on the Athenians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solon</hi> that noble and learned Athenian, was wont to revenge his wrongs with theſe words. If the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man do ſuffer the ſalt water of the Sea, to ſprinkle upon his face, and upon his cloaths, and to wet him
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107135:125"/>
when he taketh fiſh how much more ought <hi>Solon</hi> to forbear to ſpeak, to win men to be friends unto him. Surely theſe thrée Philoſophers deſerve more praiſe and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I mean <hi>Socrates, Phocion,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> for the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the evil with goodneſſe and vertue, then ever <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> or <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Theſeus</hi> which revenged evil with evil. Wherefore <hi>Chilon</hi> the Lacedemonian, being one of the Officers called <hi>Ephoti,</hi> in the City of Sparta, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demanding why he might not be likewiſe one of the five <hi>Ephoti,</hi> as well as his brother, ſaid unto his brother, Becauſe I can ſuffer wrong, and thou canſt not. Therefore Princes ought not to do wrong, nor yet revenge wrong with wrong, but with patience, ſufferance, and goodneſſe, and by doing good for evill. For thus they ſhall make foes to become friends, evill men to become good by prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill with lenity and gentleneſſe. It behoveth not a wiſe man to revenge injuries, neither doth it become a Prince to requite evill with the like, but to overcome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill with good.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> in deſpight of their Philoſophy and great knowledge the one became a ſlave to <hi>Hermia,</hi> the other a ſubject to <hi>Aſpaſia.

If then witty and wiſe men, if learned and diſcreet men, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent and ſubtil men, if ſtrong and mighty Conquerours have been ruled by luſt, deceived by beauty, overcome with women; what ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> not well na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Emperour, but worthily called the beaſt of Rome? What ſhould I recite that Monſter and Tyrant <hi>Nero?</hi> What ſhould I recite that filthy and vile Emperour <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> the onely ſink of ſin, and ſhame? not Emperors, but Monſters; not Princes, but Tyrants; not men, but beaſts which defiled their own ſiſters, kept open ſtews and brothel houſes, maintaining Whores and Harlots, made Laws, at their banquets, every man to his woman firſt, and then to his meat; and at the change of every diſh, every man again commanded by a law to go to his woman: And thus from meat to women, from women to meat they beaſtly and brutiſhly entertained their Epicurial luſt, wherein theſe Gorgons repoſed their chief felicity.</p>
               <p>Certainly if Quéen <hi>Semitamis</hi> of Babylon had been mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with <hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> Emperour of Rome, it had béen as méet a match, if time had ſerved, as one beaſt ſhould be for another; for he was not ſo filthy, but ſhe was as ſhameleſs, not onely in procuring divers to lie with her, but in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

her own ſon <hi>Ninus</hi> to luſt, and as writers report, being a beaſt, matched her ſelf with a beaſt, a horſe. Had <hi>Paſiphae</hi> Quéen of Creet been well matched, ſhe had forſaken King <hi>Minos,</hi> and come to the Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> where ſhe might have been as bold with others, as ſhe was with <hi>Minotaurus</hi> father. Had the Empreſſe <hi>Meſtalina</hi> been deſervedly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her life, married ſhe had been more meet for <hi>Nero</hi> then for <hi>Claudius;</hi> for his life and her life did well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together: for ſhe paſſed all the Courteſans of Corinth, all the ſtrumpets of Athens, and all the whores of Babilon; for ſhe was onely miſtreſſe and ruler of all the ſtews and brothel houſes in Rome</p>

The great wars between King <hi>Cambyſes</hi> of Perſia, and King <hi>Amaſis</hi> of Egypt, wherein was a great ſlaughter and murther of men, grew by luſt to one woman. The ten years betwixt the Thebans and the Phoceans, was for the luſt of one young man in Phoca towards a young woman in Thebes. The cruel conflicts that was between the Troyan Prince <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and ſtout <hi>Turnus,</hi> was the luſt which either of them did bear to <hi>Lavinia,</hi> King <hi>Latinus,</hi> Daughter.

If luſt had not ruled all the world, the deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> had not drowned the whole earth, and all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſaving <hi>Noah;</hi> his wife and children. Thus luſt from time to time was the onely Monſter and ſcourge of the World. And in this our Age luſt is nothing diminiſhed, but much encreaſed; and though we ſhall not be plagued again with Water, according to promiſe, yet to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fire moſt ſure we be, unleſſe we deteſt and abhor this vice.</p>
               <p>There is a Hiſtory in <hi>Juſtine,</hi> worthy to be noted of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that will not puniſh theſe offences. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> a Noble Gentleman of Macedonia, being a very fair young man, whom <hi>Attalus</hi> by luſt abuſed; and <hi>Attalus</hi> not contented to handle the young man ſo wickedly and ungodly, did bring him alſo to a banquet, where <hi>Attalus</hi> would have uſed him as before making all men privy how <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramour as a woman: The young man being aſhamed of it, often complained unto <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, and after many and divers complaints having no redreſſe, but being rather flouted and ſcoffed at by <hi>Philip, Pauſanias</hi> took it ſo grievouſly, that after this ſort he requited his ſhame and injuries. At the marriage of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> King <hi>Philips</hi> daughter, with <hi>Alexander</hi> King of Epirus in great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and pomps, King <hi>Philip</hi> in the midſt of his joys, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Thus died that mighty Prince, as well for the bearing of <hi>Attalus</hi> fault, as alſo for his own wickedneſſe, uſing the ſame ſin ſometime with a brother in law of his, natural brother to his firſt wife <hi>Olympias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Luſt and intemperancy do never eſcape without juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and due vengeance. <hi>Amnon</hi> the ſon of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> for that he miſuſed his own ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> was afterward ſlain. <hi>Abſalom</hi> for that he did lie with his fathers Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, died for it. <hi>David</hi> was plagued for <hi>Uriah</hi>'s wife. The two Elders that would raviſh <hi>Suſanna,</hi> were put to death. This ſin is the onely enemy of man: For all ſin (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) is without the body, but uncleanneſſe and luſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt the body. Had not <hi>Olofernes</hi> ſéen the beauty of <hi>Judith,</hi> yea, marked the comelineſſe of her ſlippers, he had not loſt his head by it. Had not <hi>Herod</hi> ſéen <hi>Herodias</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer dancing, he had not ſo raſhly granted her <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> head. Had not <hi>Eve</hi> ſéen the beauty of the Apple, ſhe had not eaten thereof.</p>
               <p>We read in Geneſis, that when the ſons of men, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beauty of women, many evils happened thereby. By ſight was <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife moved with luſt toward <hi>Joſeph</hi> her ſervant. By ſight and beauty was <hi>Solomon</hi> allured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry with falſe Gods. By ſight was <hi>Dina</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iacob</hi> raviſhed by <hi>Shechem.</hi> Theſe evils procéed from ſudden ſights; therefore ſaith the Prophet, Turn away thine eys, leſt they ſée vanities. The Philoſopher likewiſe ſaith, That the firſt offer or motion is in the eye, from ſight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth motion; from motion election; from election, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; from conſent, ſin; from ſin, death. Wherefore with the Poet I ſay, reſiſt the violence of the firſt aſſault, I mean the eys: The evil that happened thereby too long it were to write.</p>
               <p>Luſt again hath its entrance by hearing, as <hi>Juſtine</hi> in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107135:129"/>
his twelfth Book doth teſtifie of <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> Quéen ſomtime of the Amazons, who having heard the great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the fame and renown of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her life to hazard to come from Scythia to Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, which was, as <hi>Iuſtine</hi> ſaith, five and twenty days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in great danger and peril of life, as well by wild beaſts, waters, as alſo by forreign foes. She had thrée hundred thouſand women of Scythia in company with her: For the fame ſhe had heard of this great Prince, ſhe came from her Countrey, where ſhe was a Quéen, to lie with a ſtranger, to ſatisfie her luſt. And when ſhe had accompliſhed her mind, after thirty nights lying with him, ſhe returned unto her own countrey again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> doth write, that we are more moved by report of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to love, then by ſight. For as by report, Quéen <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> came to lie with <hi>Alexander,</hi> from Scythia unto Hircania, for his magnanimity, victories, and courage; ſo by report came the Quéen of Sheba from Ethiopia unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> to hear and to learn wisdome. O golden world! Oh happy age, when either for ſimplicity men could not ſpeak, or for temperance men would not ſpeak. The inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of them then, and the ſubtilty of us now; the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy of their age, and the luſt of our age, being wel weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and throughly examined, it is eaſily to be ſéen, how ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly they lived in ignorance, and how viciouſly we live in knowledge.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Aruntius,</hi> proud <hi>Tarquins</hi> ſon, was by luſt moved toward <hi>Collatines</hi> wife, there was no alterations of States, nor change of Common-wealths, no baniſhment of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Rome: And Rome being changed, for this mans luſt onely, from a Monarchy unto another ſtate, called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocracy, it continued ſo long in that form, until <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> raviſhed <hi>Virginius</hi> daughter, which was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſecond change. And the popular ſtate, which had the chief rule always in Rome, changed the ſtates of the City, for that luſt ſo reigned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:107135:130"/>Thus might I ſpeak of divers other Countreys, where luſt was the juſt cauſe of the ſubverſion of them. For by one <hi>Venus,</hi> a ſtrumpet in Cyprus, all Cyprus was full of Whores: By one <hi>Semiramis</hi> in Babilon, all Perſia at length grew full of queans: By one <hi>Rhodope</hi> in Egypt at the beginning all the country became full of ſtrumpets. In Rome <hi>Flora</hi> was honoured like a Goddeſſe, having ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and on Theaters, which were called according to her own name <hi>Floralia.</hi> In Thebes was <hi>Phrine</hi> ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that her name was put in print upon every Gate of the City. As for <hi>Lais</hi> in Corinth, and <hi>Lamia</hi> in Athens, their Fame was more heard, then their Honeſty known.</p>
               <p>It grew in fine to that ſtrength, that all the Princes of the world were as bulwarks and defenders of luſt. Yea, learned Philoſophers and wiſe Law-givers, ſéemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſame in writing. As <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wiſe men, the one a Law-giver among the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, (people in the beginning more expert in the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and flags of <hi>Mars,</hi> then ſtudious or deſirous to haunt the palaces of <hi>Venus:</hi>) The other a Law-giver in Athens (people likewiſe, more frequenting at the firſt, the ſchool of <hi>Minerva,</hi> then the lurking dens and ſecret ſnares of <hi>Cupid</hi>) theſe two famous men made laws to maintain luſt, under the colour and pretext of iſſue; every young woman being married to an old man, might for children, take choiſe what young man ſhe would of her husbands name. So likewiſe might any young man, chooſe a young woman, being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to an old woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſéemeth to defend this law after a ſort. So <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> wife <hi>Sara</hi> after a ſort, willed her husband to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with a young maid, for that he might have children. And <hi>Sempronia,</hi> a woman excellently well learned in the Gréek and Latine; and <hi>Sapho,</hi> a woman of no leſſe fame then of learning, defended luſt by their Writings. I might have large ſcope herein, to prove Luſt, as a Lord, to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern every where.</p>
               <p>I have ſufficiently, I hope, declared the effect of Luſt:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107135:130"/>
For as Princes wiſe, ſtout, and learned, have been hereto ſubject: ſo the Poets fain, that the Gods themſelves have yielded to the might of luſt. What I pray you, tranſlated <hi>Jupiter</hi> to a Bull, <hi>Neptune</hi> unto a horſe, <hi>Mercury</hi> unto a Goat? Luſt. What moved <hi>Apollo</hi> to be in love with <hi>Daphnes?</hi> What cauſed <hi>Bacchus</hi> to favour <hi>Gnoſida?</hi> What made <hi>Pan</hi> to yeeld unto <hi>Sirinx?</hi> luſt. What moved wiſe, learned, ſtout, and ſtrong as well as the fooliſh, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the weak, and the ſimple, but onely that corruption of nature, that ſeed, and dregs of <hi>Adam,</hi> which equally without grace, moveth all men to ſin? For there is no man, but he is privy to luſt, moved by luſt, and ſorely aſſaulted by it. Yet there be ſome that ſubdue luſt, ſome that rule luſt, but none that vanquiſh luſt; for as ſome are born chaſt, ſo ſome do make themſelves chaſt, and ſome who are thus made chaſt are yet not without ſome ſpice of luſt.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not of <hi>Proculus</hi> the Emperour, who kept at his pleaſure a hundred maids of Sarmatia. Neither do I think herein of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> King of Aſſyria, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The like is written of that moſt valiant Captain <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> the long defendor of the Tarentines, and King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirots, when he came from Italy unto Neapolis, being but one day there, he fell in love with a fair Lady called <hi>Gamalice,</hi> to the great, infamy of ſo famous a Prince, and to the great ſhame of ſo noble a Lady. The like luſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted that noble and renowned Conquerour <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo that when he thought to give battel to the Queen of Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons, having a ſight of her at a river ſide, where they both had appointed to come to talk concerning their wars, their fury and rage before bent to fight, and murther, was by a ſight changed into a wanton paſtime and ſport. We do read alſo that Quéen <hi>Cleopatra</hi> made a banquet for <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> her lover, in the Province of Bithinia, in the Wood Sechin, where the young virgins were not ſo cunning to hide them in the thick buſhes; but the youthfull Romans were as crafty in finding them out, ſo that at that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of ſixty young virgins, fifty and five deſerved the name of mothers. Thus we perceive that by ſight we are moved to luſt, and by conſent we wilfully ſin, the one in the eye, the other in the heart: therefore better it is with <hi>Sophocles,</hi> for a man to turn his back from a fair woman, then with <hi>Nero</hi> to behold beauty, who looking to ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly upon the haire of <hi>Poppaeas,</hi> was thereby moved to luſt.</p>

For as the Poets feign there ſprung a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Iuno,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning luſt and jealouſie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no equal judge to determine this matter, it was referred after great controverſie unto one <hi>Tireſias,</hi> an ancient and learned po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſometime in Thebes, which <hi>Tireſias</hi> on a certain time meeting two Snakes, according to kind ingendring together, having a white rod in his hand, parted at once both their bodies and their lives. Wherewith <hi>Iuno</hi> being moved to anger, tranſformed this poet <hi>Tireſias</hi> from a man to a woman and being in the ſhape of a woman ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, he again found two Snakes ingendring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in like manner ſtriking them, he was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his firſt form. This <hi>Tireſias</hi> was thought moſt meet of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Iuno,</hi> by the conſent of all the Gods, for that he had been a woman ſeven years, and now a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to judge of this queſtion. And being called to the Bar to give his verdit, he preferred <hi>Iuno</hi> for jealouſie: whereby <hi>Iuno</hi> waxed angry, and made him blind, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> to recompence his truth, did make him a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jupiter</hi> fell in love with <hi>Io, Juno</hi> being ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and full of jealouſie, cauſed one named <hi>Argos</hi> with an hundred eys to watch <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who for all his eys was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Juno</hi> thereby was ſo furious and ſo hungry with <hi>Argos,</hi> that ſhe tranſlated his eys unto a Peacocks tail, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Io</hi> to a white Cow. There is no ſuch rage in jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, as there is craft in love, ſo that the ſtreight kéeping of <hi>Danae</hi> King <hi>Acriſius</hi> daughter in Towers and Caſtles,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107135:132"/>
could never kéep her from <hi>Perſeus,</hi> neither the hundred eies of <hi>Argos</hi> might ſpie the craft of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Io.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read of a woman named <hi>Procris</hi> who was in ſuch jealouſie of her husband called <hi>Cephalus,</hi> that having him in ſuſpicion for his often going a hunting, on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time ſhe followed him privily into the Woods, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king there to find her husband at his wantonneſſe, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelf in a thick buſh, to ſée the end of the event, her husband paſſing by the buſh perceiving ſomething there to ſtir, thinking it had béen ſome wild beaſt, thruſt his wife into the heart with his dart, and thus <hi>Procris</hi> was ſlain of her own husband, for her importunate jealouſie. The like happened to <hi>Aemilius</hi> wife, who for her ſuſpicious and raging jealouſie, was never quiet, but was buſie alwaies to find ſome fault in her husband, following him every where, and watching ſtill in privy places, thinking to find him in the manner; and untill ſhe ſped of the like chance as <hi>Procris</hi> did, ſhe could never be quiet. <hi>Cyampus</hi> wife named <hi>Leuconona,</hi> was devoured by dogs inſtead of a wild beaſt, hiding her ſelf in the Woods, to follow and mark her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands voyage. Iealouſie ſo moved her, that ſhe could do no otherwiſe. A ſtrange kind of ſickneſſe it is that ſo infecteth the mind, vexeth the ſpirits, and moleſteth the heart, that the head is full of invention and the mind full of thought, and the heart full of revenge.</p>
               <p>So jealous was <hi>Phanius,</hi> that the dores being ſhut, the windows cloſe, all privy and ſecret places prevented, every where as he thought ſo ſtopped, that his wife could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him yet, never thought that love could pierce tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to come unto his wife; but he was deceived, for the lurking dens of love, and fancies, and the ſecret ſearch of affection hath more privy paths, whereby <hi>Cupid</hi> may come to his mother <hi>Venus,</hi> then the Labyrinth had chambers for the Minotaur. King <hi>Acriſius</hi> thought he was ſure of his daughter <hi>Danae</hi> when ſhe was cloſe bulwarked within a great Caſtle: <hi>Iuno</hi> thought to prevent <hi>Iupiter</hi> by the hundred eys of <hi>Argos, Phanius</hi> thought that his wife was ſure enough
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107135:132"/>
when the dores were ſhut, and the windows cloſe, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the jealouſie of <hi>Iuno</hi> prevent it, neither the eys of <hi>Argos</hi> ſpie it, neither the ſtreight kéeping of <hi>Danae</hi> avoid it, neither the cloſe defence of <hi>Phanius</hi> defend it.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs commend one called <hi>Cippius,</hi> that would oftentimes take upon him to ſleep when he did wake, and would pretend to be ignorant though he knew it. I wiſh wiſe men to ſleep with <hi>Cippius,</hi> and to ſay with <hi>Cicero, <hi>Non omnibus dormio,</hi>
                  </hi> I ſleep not to all men, and to be ignorant though they know things. And likewiſe I wiſh wiſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to imitate <hi>Aemilia,</hi> the wife of noble <hi>Scipio,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe knew things evident by <hi>Scipio,</hi> yet ſhe made as much of his Paramour, as ſhe made of her husband, and all for his own ſake.</p>
               <p>They ſay jealouſie proceedeth from love, and love from God, but I ſay it commeth from hatred, and hatred from the Divel. And yet we read in the ſacred Scripture, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was jealous of his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſaying thus to his wife, I know that thou art fair, and they will kill me to have thy love. The manners of the Parthians, were to keep their wives in privy places of their houſes, over whom they were ſo jealous, that their wives might not go abroad but with covered faces. The Perſians were ſo ſuſpicious of their wives, that they had no liberty to go in ſight, and they durſt not go on foot, but in Wagons covered over leſt they ſhould ſee or be ſeen. The Thracians with ſuch care and ſtudy keep their wives, that as <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirms, they truſt no man with them in company, but their own parents. The old and ancient Romans in times paſt kept their wives ſo cloſe, that their wives as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſaith, did divers times, either kill poiſon or with ſome cruelty or other deſtroy their husbands, and it was by a young man of the city of Rome diſcloſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was a hundred threeſcore and ten, that ſo killed and deſtroyed their husbands, for that their husbands were ſo jealous over them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a comon diſeaſe in all places, I need not further
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107135:133"/>
to write thereof, wiſhing my friend, never to be incumbred therewith, but rather with ſilence to paſſe it with <hi>Cippius,</hi> and ſo he ſhall find eaſe thereby.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S nothing can be greatly difficult to a willing mind, ſo every thing is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the idle, one for as labor &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of body, &amp; induſtry &amp; diligence of mind are ſure and ſtrong bulwarks of countries, ſo are idleneſſe and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the cauſe of all evill. We read that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, leaſt he ſhould be acquainted with idleneſſe at any time, even in the night time uſed this art, to hold a ſilver ball when he went to bed in his hand, having a ſilver baſon upon the ground that when the ball ſhould fall, he being faſt aſléep, the ſhrill ſound thereof ſhould wake him, and make him mindfull of his enemies: ſo fearfull was this noble prince of idleneſſe, that to ſhake off ſléep and ſlothfulneſſe, he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and travelled, how he might avoid it. For <hi>Alexander</hi> the great being called the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with himſelf that he was of the linnage of the Gods, had ſpecial regard of ſléep and luſt, whereto he being ſo much ſubject, knew himſelf to be a man: wherefore he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes wraſtled with nature in that behalf. In the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame place of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> it is read, that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> the greateſt and moſt renowned Emperour that ever reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Rome, followed this order, and practiſed this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, leaſt he ſhould be idle at any time. For firſt, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice nature, he ſlept a certain time appointed. Secondly, he would be occupied in the affairs of his country. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he travelled in his private ſtudy. Thus leaſt he ſhould be idle, nay rather, leaſt he ſhould loſe any time he divided every night into thrée parts, firſt to nature, ſecondly to his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107135:133"/>
country, thirdly about his own buſineſſe. The mighty Prince <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon as we read in <hi>Bruſonius,</hi> was of ſuch care and diligence, that when his ſouldiers ſlept, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies watched. Again, he never ſlept, untill his friend <hi>Antipater</hi> were firſt awake. So that betwéen King <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> diligence was as much honoured and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as ſlothfulneſſe was feared and hated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> that renowned Prince of Thebes, being ſtudious and profitable to profit his country, ſo hated idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that finding one of his Captains in the Camp in the day time ſléeping, he ſlue him ſtreight with his own hand, and being reprehended by his Nobles and Counſellours, for that cruell fact he anſwered them in few words, I left him as I found him; comparing idle and drowſie men to dead men, for men are born to travell and watch, and not to take pleaſure and ſtéep. How did <hi>Scipio</hi> in Affrica over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Tents of <hi>Siphax?</hi> how vanquiſhed he his hoſt of ſouldiers, ſlew his army, and how took he King <hi>Siphax</hi> captive himſelf. <hi>Livius</hi> ſaith, that the diligence of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the ſloathfulneſſe of <hi>Siphax</hi> being a ſleep, when he ſhould be waking, was the cauſe thereof. Had <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> loved idleneſſe, he had never been able to prevent that famous Prince <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon: he was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent to the ſtate of Athens, that that worthy Captain and great Conquerour <hi>Philip,</hi> was wont to ſay, that he doubted more the diligence of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> then he feared all the force of Athens. Had <hi>Cicero</hi> ſlept, during the conſpiracy of <hi>Catelin,</hi> he had never been able worthily to boaſt of himſelf. O happy Rome, that ever I was thy Conſul. Studious travel, ſaved oftentimes Rome from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quintilian</hi> reciteth a worthy hiſtory of a famous ſcholler named <hi>Hippias,</hi> who to avoid idleneſſe after long ſtudying of his book, would exerciſe himſelf in ſomething or other, leaſt he might ſeem to be idle, inſomuch that he applied himſelf to divers faculties at void hours, and uſed to pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe the faculty of a Goldſmith, of a Tailor, of a Shoo-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107135:134"/>
inſomuch that at length he became his own Taylor, his own Shoemaker, yea, to make his own rings ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as though he had been brought up in the ſchool of <hi>Praxiules.</hi> What is ſo hard but diligence will attempt it? What is ſo déep, but travel will wade through it? What is ſo ſtrange, but ſtudy will know it? Labour and diligence are of Wiſe men much commended by the example of the Bée, that is buſie and carefull, and knoweth how to profit her ſelf and others. If the little Ants be ſo praiſed, for that they toyl in the Summer to provide againſt the Winter: If the ſilly ſimple Worms do provide things neceſſary for them and theirs: How much more ought man, who is born to profit his countrey, his Prince, his friends and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to conſider the commodity of diligence, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of idleneſſe? But it is before mentioned, vices are covered with the names of vertues; as the idle man is noted to be a quiet man, the ignorant termed an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caelius</hi> doth write of a certain Emperor named <hi>Attalus,</hi> which ſo well loved idleneſſe, that he gave the government of the Empire to his friend <hi>Philopenes</hi> for that he would be idle. We read again of one <hi>Vatia,</hi> a great ruler and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in Aſia, that loved idleneſſe ſo well, that the people uſed a proverb, when they ſaw any man idle, to ſay, He is an idle ſcholler of <hi>Vatiaes.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Licinius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentianus</hi> were ſuch enemies to learning, and ſo ignorant, as <hi>Egnatius</hi> doth report, that they called Learning the onely poiſon of the world, and named them that were learned, the Aſſes of <hi>Cuma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who hated learning ſo much as <hi>Heraclides</hi> and <hi>Philoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> which were ſo ignorant, that they were as <hi>Caelius</hi> doth teſtifie, had of the common people in great deriſion, Theſe blind men did call others Aſſes of <hi>Cuma,</hi> when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were far inferiour to any Aſſe in the world. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Aſſes had more reaſon then <hi>Philonides</hi> or <hi>Heraclides</hi> had. We read that <hi>Ammonius</hi> a great philoſopher of Alexandria, had an Aſſe which would keep company with <hi>Origen</hi> and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107135:134"/>
                  <hi>Porphirius</hi> to frequent the ſchool of <hi>Amonius,</hi> to hear him read Philoſophy and to his ſchollers, the Aſſe was taught to know the reader, as the ſchollers were to know the ſchool at the time of reading.</p>
               <p>The ſacred Scripture commends tons the Aſſe of <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> who was likewiſe taught to ſpeak and to ſhew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Balaam</hi> the will of God. But the idle and ignorant, will neither learn to know time, place, nor perſon, neither to profit themſelves nor others. Theſe laſie members, theſe idle and ignorant beaſts, are the children of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping alwaies in the cave of <hi>Pamedes,</hi> to whom it well may be ſpoken, as <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſometime an Emperour of Rome. ſpake unto one <hi>Bonoſius,</hi> that he was born to drink, and not to live.</p>
               <p>The Romans uſed to puniſh idleneſſe ſo ſharply, that the Husbandman that had his ground barren, and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, Meadows, or Fields untilled, any other man ſhould be there placed, and he put out. The Gentleman that had not his horſe ready, and in good liking, with all things thereunto belonging, ſhould be ſuſpected to be an idle mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unto his country, and ſhould be hated and eſchued by the people. The common people might uſe no kind of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate pleaſure, as plaies, paſtime, or any other idle ſport, but at times appointed. The gates of Rome were opened day and night, to come and to go for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, &amp; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, the life &amp; manners of all men were ſtrictly examined, whether they lived idle or no. And if any did reſiſt the order of the Magiſtrates, his head ſhould be cut off, &amp; offered to <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Capitol of Rome, his family to the temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> his children ſhould be ſold as bondmen to the Tribunes and Cenſors.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians were moſt ſtudiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to expel idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and brought their children up always in hardneſſe to practiſe them in the Arts of Induſtry, and hated Idleneſſe ſo much, that if any in the City of Sparta waxed groſſe or fat, they ſtraight ſuſpected him of idleneſſe; and if any young man waxed fat, they had appointed laws that he ſhould faſt,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107135:135"/>
and live poor, untill he were again changed into his firſt eſtate,</p>
               <p>The Egyptians, an ancient people, when the country of Egypt began to be populous, to avoid idleneſſe, as <hi>Pliny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, made the great building called the Pyramides, which for the mightineſſe and ſtrange working thereof, was named one of the ſeven wonders of the World, in which there were kept at work, thréeſcore thouſand young men, who continued a long time in the making thereof, and onely to avoid and baniſh idleneſſe. The Athenians ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrid and deteſted idleneſſe, that when a certain man was condemned to die, for that he was found idle in Athens, a citizen thereof named <hi>Herondas,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifieth, was as deſirous to ſee him, as though he had been a prodigious Monſter; ſo ſtrange and ſo marvellous was it to hear, or to ſee any idle man in Athens. The people called the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians, would ſuffer no travellers, neither Pilgrim, nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer, nor any other ſtranger to come within their City, leſt under colour of religion, or of pilgrimage, they might corrupt the youth of the City, with the ſight thereof to be idle. The Indians had a law, made by their Wiſe-men called Gymnoſophiſts, that after meat was ſet on the table, the youth ſhould be examined, what they had done for their meat, and what pain and labour they had uſed all the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before; if they could make account of their travel, they ſhould goe to dinner; but if they had béen idle they ſhould have no meat except they had deſerved the ſame. The like did the young men of Argis, who made an account to their Magiſtrates of their occupations and works. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reopagites, as <hi>Valerius</hi> affirmeth did imitate the Athenians in commanding their youth to avoid idleneſſe, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe travel, the one as neceſſary to any Commonwealth, as the other is moſt dangerous. So that ſome countreys are naturally given to travel, as the Lydians, Phrygians, French men, with others. Some again are given to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the Perſians, Corinthians and others. Some by law were forced to ſlie idleneſſe, ſome by puniſhment were
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107135:135"/>
feared from it, ſome by death were enforced to labour for their living. Thus this Monſter Idleneſſe is beaten every where, and yet embraced in moſt places; every man ſpeaks againſt idleneſſe, yet a number are in love with it; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Officers are appointed to puniſh it, and yet they often favour it.</p>

Anger in a Prince (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) is death; terrible is the countenance of a King when he is oppreſſed with Wrath; hurtfull to many, and dangerous to all is the anger thereof. <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo furious in anger, that he never heard any thing, if it were not to his liking, but he would requite it one way or other with death, inſomuch that in his rage and anger he would often throw down tables, being at dinner, and daſh cups of gold wrought with pearls againſt the walls, and fling all away, more like to a furious Gorgon of hell, then a ſober Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Rome.</p>

The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher took a pen, and wrote in a little Table this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: <hi>Caeſar <hi>when thou art moved to anger, ſpeak nothing till thou haſt recited the Greekes Alphabet:</hi>
                  </hi> a worthy leſſon and a famous ſentence, well worthy to be learned of all men.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, neither can there be any thing more ugly to behold, then mans face when he is angry, nor to be feared becauſe he hath no rule over himſelf. All the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Perſia had much to do to draw in colours the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible countenance and fiery face of Queen <hi>Semiramis,</hi> when ſhe heard that her City of Babylon was beſieged by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, being then dreſſing of her head: ſhe came with her hairs hand flying in the wind half amazed at the news. Her picture in this diſcontent and fury, ſtood as long as Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon continued, as a monument and a terrible mirrour to poſterity.</p>
               <p>We read of the like hiſtory of <hi>Olimpias,</hi> whoſe anger was ſuch, when ſhe thought of her ſon <hi>Alexander,</hi> that ſhe ſtraight ways like a raging Lion or a cruel Tiger, digged up the body of <hi>Iolas, Alexanders</hi> murtherer, and tare his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in ſmall pieces, and gave it to the birds of the air. Such anger was in <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> towards <hi>Cicero,</hi> that he was not contented at <hi>Ciceroes</hi> death, but comanded his head to be ſet before him on the Table, to féed therewith his wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, and gréedy eys; and his wife <hi>Fulvia</hi> to ſhew her anger, pulled out his tongue, and pinned it to her hood, and ware it on her head, in token of her cruel and Tigriſh heart.</p>
               <p>The noble Roman <hi>Metellus</hi> was ſo inflamed againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> for at what time he was appointed by the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Rome, to ſuccéed <hi>Metellus</hi> in his pro-conſulſhip in Spaine. <hi>Metellus</hi> perceiving that hee was diſcharged,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107135:137"/>
he brake for very anger, all the furniture of wars, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroied all the proviſion, he famiſhed the Elephants, and permitted his ſouldiers to do what injury they could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pompey;</hi> ſo great was his anger that to hinder <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> he injured his native City of Rome. The property of anger is, to hurt divers, in ſéeking to offend one. As he is not wiſe that cannot be angry, ſo he is moſt wiſe that can moderate anger.</p>
               <p>The fame and renown that both <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> got, in vanquiſhing their anger one towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was great: for being ſent both as Embaſſadours for the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Anger and wrath are the onely poiſon of the world, whence hidden hatred doth procéed, for to nouriſh the one is to féed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Aith is the foundation of Iuſtice, and Iuſtice is the chief means (as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> ſaith) to preſerve a Publick Weal. We will therefore note how faithfull &amp; juſt ſome Princes have béen, &amp; how wicked and falſe others have ſhewed themſelves; there are ſo many vertues in the one, and vices in the other. For ſome from foes become friends, as <hi>Clodius</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> two great enemies a long time, and yet before two faithfull friends. <hi>Tiberius</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Affricanus</hi> from mortal foes, grew to be ſuch perpetual friends, that <hi>Affricanus</hi> gave his onely daughter <hi>Cornelia</hi> in marriage to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Even ſo ſome again from friends became foes, yea from tried friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to mortal enmity; as <hi>Dion</hi> of Siracuſa was killed by <hi>Calicrates</hi> his moſt aſſured friend (as he thought) with whom alwaies before, he found friendſhip and faith. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limneſtor</hi> likewiſe though King <hi>Priamus</hi> repoſed ſuch great truſt and confidence in him that he committed his own ſon <hi>Polidorus</hi> to his cuſtody, yet he falſly ſlew him, and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, though beſide friendſhip, he was his near kinſman. How well ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> do faithfull friends far excell all Gold, for in danger faith is tried, and in neceſſity friends are known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:107135:138"/>Such is the ſecret force of truth and love, and ſuch is the hidden ſubtilty of falſhood, as may be proved in a hiſtory of <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> ſon and heir unto <hi>Pompey</hi> the great. The faith and juſtice of <hi>Pompey</hi> at what time he had appointed a banquet for <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> upon the ſeas was well tried; for being moved by divers at that time, to revenge his fathers death <hi>Pompeius</hi> the great, and eſpecially at that time being prompted to it by his friend, and maſter of the ſhip, whoſe name was <hi>Menedorus, Sextus</hi> in no wiſe would ſuffer it, ſaying: that faith and juſtice ought not to be turned into perjury and falſhood; for, ſaid he, as it is perjury to omit faith and promiſe made to theſe Emperours, ſo this is tyranny, and not juſtice, to revenge my fathers death upon innocence. And true it was, that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> was then but a boy and brought up in ſchool in Apulia, when his uncle <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> vanquiſhed <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi> And <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was rather a friend to <hi>Sextus</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a foe, and therefore no leſſe faithfull was <hi>Sextus</hi> in preſerving, then juſt in weighing innocency.</p>
               <p>Far unlike was falſe <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who under pretence of peace with the Romans, ſent Embaſſadours unto Rome to treat thereof, where they were honourably received: but well requited he the courteſie of Rome to his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. For when that noble Roman <hi>Cornelius</hi> came from Rome, as an Embaſſadour unto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> his welcome was ſuch, that he never went alive unto Rome again; for moſt cruelly and falſly was he ſlain by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> In this falſhood and perjury, was <hi>Hannibal</hi> much defamed, whoſe vertues were not ſo much corrupted by the vileneſſe of his own nature, as by the falſhood and corruption of the Countrey, which alwaies in this was not to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; of which it is proverbially ſpoked, <hi>Poeni perfidi,</hi> the Carthaginians are falſe, for the people of Carthage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in falſhood, practiſed perjury, and uſed all kind of crafts, as the people of Sarmatha were moſt falſe in words, moſt deceitfull in déeds, and moſt cruell one towards the other.</p>

Princes, the betraying of Kingdoms, the oppreſſing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents from time to time, in all places can well witneſſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Romulus</hi> had appointed <hi>Spu. Tarpeius</hi> to be chief Captain of the Capitol, the chamber of Rome, where the ſubſtance and wealth of Rome did remain; <hi>Tarpeia, Spurius</hi> daughter, in the night time, as ſhe went for water out of the city, méeting <hi>Tatius</hi> King of the Sabines, though he was then a mortal enemy to Rome, and in continual wars with <hi>Romulus,</hi> yet by her falſhood and policy he was brought to be Lord of the Capitol. Thus <hi>Tarpeia</hi> was as falſe to Rome, as King <hi>Tatius</hi> was to <hi>Tarpeia;</hi> for ſhe looking to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe kept by <hi>Tatius,</hi> did find him as Rome found her: ſhe was buried alive by <hi>Tatius</hi> cloſe to the Capitol, which was then called <hi>Saturnus</hi> Mount, and after her death and burial it was named <hi>Tarpeiaes</hi> Rock, untill <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> did name it the Capitol, by finding a mans head in that place.</p>
               <p>There was never in Rome ſuch falſhood ſhewed by any man, as was by <hi>Sergius Galba,</hi> who cauſed the Magiſtrates of three famous cities in Luſitania to appear before him, promiſing them great commodities, concerning the ſtates and Government of their Cities, yéelding his faith and truth for the accompliſhment of the ſame; whoſe profeſſed faith allured to the number of Nine thouſand young msn, picked and elected for ſome enterpriſe for the profit of their countrey: But when falſe <hi>Galba</hi> had ſpoiled theſe thrée ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Flower of all their Youth againſt all promiſe and faith, he ſlue the moſt part of them, ſold and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the reſt, whereby he moſt eaſily might conquer their Cities.</p>
               <p>Men are never certain nor truſty in doing when they are faulty in Faith: For as the Sun lighteneth the Moon ſo Faith maketh Man in all things perfect. For Prudence without Faith is Vain-glory and Pride; Temperance without Faith and Truth is Shamefacedneſſe or ſadneſſe; Iuſtice without Faith is turned into Injury, &amp; Fortitude
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107135:139"/>
into Slothfulneſſe. The orders in divers countreys for the obſervation of Friendſhip, and for maintainance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſure love one towards another, were Oaths of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. The noble Romans, at what time they ſware, had this order, He or ſhe to take a ſlint ſtone in their right hand, ſaying theſe words, If I be guilty, or offend any man, if I betray my countrey, or deceive my friend willingly. I wiſh to be caſt away out of Rome by great <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as I caſt this ſtone out of my hand. And therewith threw the ſtone away.</p>
               <p>The ancient Scythians, to obſerbe amity and love, had this Law: They poured a great quantity of wine into a great Boul, and with their knives opened ſome vein in their bodies, letting their bloud to run out one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the boul, and then mingling the wine and bloud together, they dipped the end of their ſpears and their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in the wine, and taking the boul into their hands, they drank one to another, profeſſing by that draught, faith and love. The Arabians when they would become faithfull to any, to maintain love thereby had this cuſtome: One did ſtand with a ſharp ſtone betwéen two, and with it made bloud to iſſue from the palms of both their hands, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from either of them a piece of their garment, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their bloud, he dipped ſeven ſtones in the bloud; and calling <hi>Urania</hi> and <hi>Dioniſius</hi> their Gods to witneſſe their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they kept the ſtones in memory of their friendſhip, and departed one from another. The like law was among the Barcians who repairing to a Ditch, and ſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, would ſay, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirmeth, As long as that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low place or ditch were not of it ſelf filled up, ſo long they deſired amity and love.</p>
               <p>In reading of Hiſtories, we find more certainty to have béen in the Heathen by prophane Oaths then truth often in us by Evangeliſt and Goſpel Oaths; leſſe perjury in thoſe Gentiles, ſwearing by <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> then in Chriſtians ſwearing by the true and iiving God; more amity and friendſhip amongſt them, with drinking either of others

The faith and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> was ſo wondred at by King <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſius,</hi> that though he was a cruel Tyrant, in appointing <hi>Damon</hi> to die, yet was he ſo amazed to ſée the deſire of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> his conſtant faith, and his love and friendſhip proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Damons</hi> behalf, ſtriving one with another to die, that he was inforced in ſpight of tyranny to pardon <hi>Damon</hi> for <hi>Pythias</hi> ſake. <hi>Thelcus</hi> and <hi>Perithous</hi> became ſuch faithfull friends, that they made ſeveral oaths one unto another, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver during life to be parted, neither in affliction, plague, puniſhment, pain toil, or travel to be diſſevered: inſomuch that the Poets fain, that they went unto the Kingdome, and region of <hi>Pluto</hi> together. I will not ſpeak of the great love of that noble Greek <hi>Achilles</hi> toward King <hi>Patroclus:</hi> Neither will I recite the hiſtory of that worthy Roman <hi>Titus</hi> toward <hi>Giſippus,</hi> nor report the love of <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Arceir,</hi> nor of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Lodwick,</hi> whoſe end and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in love were ſuch, as is worthy of everlaſting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Of Envy and Malice, and the tyranny of Princes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Malice drinketh for the moſt part her own poiſon, ſo Envy ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hurteth more the envious it ſelf, then the thing that it envieth. Like as the ſloathfull in war, or Darnel amongſt Wheat, ſo is the envious in a City: not ſo ſad for his own miſeries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, as he lamenteth the hap and and felicity of others. Wherefore the Philoſopher <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> calleth the enemy <hi>ſerrom anima,</hi> the ſow of the ſoul, for that it cutteth the heart of the envious to ſée the proſperity of others. For as it is a grief to good and vertuous men to ſée evill men rule: ſo contraily to the evill moſt harm it is to ſée good men live. Therefore, the firſt diſturber of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths and laſt deſtroyer of good ſtates: the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all ſorrows, the end of all joys: the cauſe of all evil, and the onely let of all goodneſſe; is envy.</p>
               <p>How proſpered Greece? Had flouriſhed Rome? How quiet was the whole world? before envy began to practiſe with malice, two daughters of tyranny, never ſéen, but hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the hearts of flatterers? Then, I ſay, Gréece was glorious, Rome was famous, their names were honoured, their proweſſe feared, their policy commended, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge extolled, their fame ſpread over the whole world: but when envy began to ſojourn in Gréece, and malice to build her Bower in Rome; theſe ſiſters (like two monſters, or two grim Gorgons) oppreſſed Caſtles, deſtroied countries, ſubdued Kingdoms, depopulated Cities: in fine, triumphed over all Gréece and Italy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> chief General of the Carthaginians, <hi>Jugurth</hi> King of Numidia <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> of Epirus, moſt valiant, puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant &amp; mighty Princes, with long wars, and mighty ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, could not with all their force and power hurt Rome ſo

much as their hidden hatred betwéen themſelves did. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Cyrus</hi> the valiant, <hi>Xerxes</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, moſt mighty Conquerors, with all their ſtrength of wars, could not annoy Greece half ſo much as their inward Envy betwéen the Cities of Gréece.

               <p>Envy firſt entred into the hearts of Princes arreſted the worthieſt Conquerors, waded into the bowels of the wiſe, and bluſhed not to attaint the learned Philoſophers in the middeſt of Athens. <hi>Hercules</hi> in killing the great Dragon that watched in the garden of Heſperides, in deſtroying the ravening birds Stimphalides, in conquering the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and furious Centaurs, in vanquiſhing terrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Such ſlaughter grew of Envy, that one brother killed another, the ſon the father, and the father likewiſe the ſon;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107135:142"/>
as <hi>Romulus</hi> ſlew his brother <hi>Remus</hi> through envy, leſt he might be King in <hi>Rome.

Envy cauſed <hi>Anacha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus envy was known and ſeen to be betwixt brethren, betwixt parents and their children.</p>
               <p>The like we read that envy committed horrible and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible murthers as well betwixt the husband and the wife, as in the children towards their Parents, as in ſhort exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is verified. <hi>Clicenmeſtra</hi> ſlew her own husband <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> and ſhe again was ſlain by her ſon <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> Queen <hi>Semi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r ſon <hi>Nero</hi> O cruel tyranny that envy ſhould ever cauſe ſuch unnatural murther, as one brother to kill another: the father to deſtroy his ſon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon to ſlay his fathsr y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> husband to murther his wife, the wife to make away her husband.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Pliny</hi> of a certain King in Thebes named <hi>Athamas,</hi> that gave both his ſons, the one named <hi>Learchus</hi> the other <hi>Euriclea,</hi> to be devoured by ravenous Lions. So many monſtrous tyrants have been brought up in the ſchool of envy, ſo many deformed Centaures, that all countries have been full of them. When <hi>Antiphiles</hi> ſaw <hi>Apelles</hi> in great favour with King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> he ſo envied the matter, that he told the King in ſpight to <hi>Apelles,</hi> that <hi>Apelles</hi> was the very cauſe of the long wars between the Tyrians and Egypt, to diſcredit <hi>Apelles</hi> for very envy that he was great with the King, but the matter being known, and his envy weighed, <hi>Apelles</hi> was rewarded by the King with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents, and <hi>Antiphiles</hi> for his envy commanded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward all the daies of his life to be the ſlave and bonomen of <hi>Apelles. Themiſtocles</hi> was ſo grieved to ſee <hi>Miltiades</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:107135:143"/>
ſo honoured for his great conqueſt and triumph in Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, that being demanded why he was ſo ſad, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mitiades</hi> triumphs will not ſuffer <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to be joyfull.</p>
               <p>There was no countrey but envy bare ſway in it; there was never any great vertue, but it was accompanied with envy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was envied in Rome by <hi>Cato; Turnus</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in Rutilia by <hi>Drances; Uliſſes</hi> was envied in Gréece by <hi>Ajax; Demetrius</hi> was envied in Macedonia after King <hi>Caſſander</hi> died: What envy <hi>M. Craſſus</hi> bare toward <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> is ſufficiently known: What hidden hatred <hi>Pollio</hi> had toward <hi>Cicero,</hi> may be read in <hi>Bruſonius</hi> the third book, the ſeventh chapter, where <hi>Pollio</hi> ſaith to <hi>Meſſala,</hi> that he could not endure the voice of <hi>Cicero.</hi> The like we read of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> who envied <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ſo much that he was wont to ſay; It were a ſhame to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to hold his peace, and let <hi>Iſocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſpeak. For as there is no light (ſaith <hi>Pliny</hi>) without a ſhadow, ſo there is no vertue or glory without envy.</p>
               <p>The wavering ſtate of the vulgar, which always ruled Rome and Athens, was ſo mutable and uncertain, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wiſe and ſage <hi>Socrates</hi> was condemned to die being dead, the Athenians repented, his accuſers were baniſhed, and <hi>Socrates</hi> now being dead, had his pictures erected; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, the rude and uncertain people eſtéemed nothing. Even ſo was <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> baniſhed into Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, <hi>Iphicrates</hi> into Thrace, <hi>Conon</hi> into the province of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poros, <hi>Chabrias</hi> into Egypt, and <hi>Cares</hi> into Sigeum; men of excellent vertues, of noble ſervice, of renowned fame; yet by the envious people they were baniſhed their own countreys to range abroad the world. Again, <hi>Homer</hi> was envied by <hi>Zoilus, Pindarus</hi> by <hi>Amphimanes, Simonides</hi> by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocreon;</hi> yea, learned <hi>Maro</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> were envied and backbiten by <hi>Maevius</hi> and <hi>Suffenus.</hi> What do I ſpeaking of envy? Why waſt I time to write of envy? Wherefore ſeem I ſo fond to touch a general ſubject, being ſo common with all men, ſo nouriſhed in all countreys, being known from the beginning of the world, and being firſt practiſed by
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107135:143"/>
the Devil; who envying mans ſtate, the felicity, joy, and pleaſure hee was in, leſt man ſhould poſſeſſe the place where ſomtime the Devil reigned as an Angel, he decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved man?</p>
               <p>This envy took root then in the firſt Age; for <hi>Cain</hi> envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> that he ſlue him, for that God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſacrafice of <hi>Abel,</hi> and refuſed his. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was by his own brethren ſold into Egypt, for envy that he was better beloved of his father then they were. <hi>Saul</hi> did envy King <hi>David,</hi> that he gave his daughter <hi>Michal</hi> in marriage to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> for that ſhe being his daughter, might betray her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the Philiſtines. <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> had great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy toward <hi>Aaron. Daniel</hi> was much envied in the Palace of King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> What ſhould I be long in this? The Apoſtles, the Prophets the Martyrs, yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was envyed at by the Iews and Gentiles; inſomuch that tyranny and murther was the ſequel of envy, as from time to time hath been tried, from age to age ſéen, and from man to man practiſed nay, even to dead men it hath béen ſhewed; as <hi>Achilles</hi> did to <hi>Hector,</hi> by haling and drawing his body about the fields of Troy, in the open ſight of King <hi>Priam</hi> his father. So <hi>M. Antonius</hi> did to <hi>Cicero,</hi> having the head of <hi>Cicero</hi> ſet before him, to eaſe his Tygeriſh mind, permitting his wife <hi>Fulvin</hi> to wear the tongue of <hi>Cicero</hi> on her Coyf. This <hi>Cambyſes</hi> ſhewed to the Iudge <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I might well declare the tyranny of <hi>Tullia,</hi> ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her father King <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> being dead, who cauſed her Chariot and horſes to tread on her fathers body in the open ſtréets. I might ſpeak of <hi>Tomyris</hi> Queen of Scythia toward King <hi>Cyrus</hi> being dead, who did ſtrike off his head, and did bathe it in bloud. I might make mention of the tyranny of <hi>Alexander</hi> in Theſſaly, and of <hi>Buſiris</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. I might open the wicked life and ſtate of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in Syracuſa; of cruel <hi>Creon</hi> in Thebes; of <hi>Periander</hi> in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107135:144"/>
Corinth, and of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> in Athens: But I ſhould be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to amplifie that which may be briefly examined. And this we read and ſee daily by experience, that the end of Tyrants is to die in tyranny, and as they deal with others, ſo are they dealt withal themſelves. As <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris</hi> were wont to féed their horſes with mens fleſh, and to quench their thirſt with mens bloud; ſo were they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vanquiſhed by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and made food to be eaten and devoured by their own horſes, which they before fed with other mens fleſh. Likewiſe the great tyrant <hi>Phalaris</hi> and that cruel <hi>Perillus,</hi> were both deſtroyed with thoſe new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented torments that they made for others: I mean the brazen Bull which <hi>Perillus</hi> made to ſatisfie the tyranny of <hi>Phalaris. Thraſillus</hi> and <hi>Scyron;</hi> the one teaching the way of tyranny, was firſt of all in that which he taught unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, tormented and ſlain: the other, thrown headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea by <hi>Theleus,</hi> even ſo as he was wont to do unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. What ſhould I ſpeak of the great cruelty of <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who as <hi>Ariſtides</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth teſtifie uſed to recompence any man that would and could invent new torments to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the innocent, and to pleaſure his divelliſh minde: He (I ſay) dwelling in <hi>Ageſta</hi> a City of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> made a braſen horſe to vexe and torment the people, wherein through the commandement of <hi>Armmius Paterculus</hi> chief Magiſtrate of the City, he firſt ſuffered the aſſay of his new invented work. We read again of King <hi>Danaus</hi> fifty daughters, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Belides,</hi> which being maried to the fifty ſonnes of <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> ſlew all their huſbands the firſt night, except <hi>Linceus</hi> who was preſerved by <hi>Hypermeneſtra</hi> his wife. The like we reade of the thirty ſiſters of <hi>Albina,</hi> who after the ſame manner made an end of thirty huſbands in one night. The ſequel of tyranny was ſuch, that what wanted in the father, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s fully ſupplied in the ſonne, for amendment is ſeldome ſéen: And that was very well conſidered of a ſimple wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man named <hi>Ihera,</hi> who when ſhe perceived that the people of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> did wiſh the death of <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the tyrant, ſhe ſtraight knéeled upon her knées, and beſought the Gods
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107135:144"/>
that he might live; and being demanded why ſhe prayed for ſuch a tyrant? ſhe ſaid; I knew three Kings in <hi>Siracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> every one a tyrant; the ſecond worſe then the firſt, the the third worſe then the ſecond, and now <hi>Dioniſius</hi> being the fourth is worſe then the third; and I am doubtfull if a fourth ſhould come, it would be the Divel himſelf, who is worſe then <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and therefore I pray the Gods he may live; for of two evils the leaſt is to be choſen. Mark how in a ſimple woman, a ſilly perſon truth doth often ſojourn. The like we read of a certain husbandman, that digged in the ground, when the murtherers that ſlew King <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> paſſing in haſt, taking their flight into Phrygia, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the husbandman why he digged ſo déep; I dig up (ſaid he) another King <hi>Antigonus</hi> to rule in Macedonia: letting them to underſtand the true Proverb. <hi>That ſeldome comes the better;</hi> that he that would come after ſhould be far worſe then King <hi>Antigonus.</hi> O happy age! O golden world, while tyranny was not known!</p>
               <p>The great Monarchies of the world were gotten with tyranny, and likewiſe through tyranny loſt. The firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy after the great Deluge, was that of the Aſſyrians; which began under <hi>Ninus</hi> the third King of the Aſſyrians, and continued in ſlaughter and tyranny till <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> time, who was the laſt King, which was a thouſand two hundred nine and thirty years. From the Aſſyrians it was won with the ſword, and brought with violence and tyranny by that cruel and bloudy <hi>Arbactus</hi> to the Medes, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there till the time of King <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> who was the ninth and laſt King of the Medes, two hundred and fifty years: From the Medes it was had away by tyranny to Perſia, by King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and there ſtayed until the time of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> which was two hundred and thirty years: From the Perſians it was with bloud and great ſlaughter taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great unto Macedonia, and there maintained till <hi>Perſeus</hi> time, which was a hundred and ſeven and fifty years. From the Macedonians it was poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Rome, where under <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the proudeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107135:145"/>
in all the world, it fomed in bloud, flouriſhed in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny a long time. Thus tyranny was fed and foſtered from one country to another, till almoſt the whole world was deſtroied.</p>
               <p>The murther and tyranny that long flouriſhed in Gréece betwéen the Thebans and the Lacedemonians, again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lacedemonians and the Athenians, betwixt the Athenians and all Greece, who readeth it not in <hi>Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Tamberlan,</hi> the great murtherer, King ſometime in Scythia, got through tyranny Medea Albania, Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia Perſia, and Armenia, he paſſed over Euphrates, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Aſia the leſſe, and took <hi>Baiazet</hi> King of the Turks, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Princes of Aſia in his voyage toward Gréece, where ſuch tyranny was uſed that not onely Cities and Countries were deſtroyed, but alſo their Temples and their Gods neglected and ſpoiled. Great was the tyranny betwixt King <hi>Darius</hi> of Perſia, and <hi>Miltiades</hi> Prince of Athens, who ſlew a hundred thouſand of <hi>Darius</hi> men? How great was the ſlaughter of King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after he had exiled his Grandfather King <hi>Aſtrages</hi> from Perſia, vanquiſhed the Babylonians, and overthrew <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of Lydia, and after he had ſubdued the moſt part of Aſia, he ceaſed not his tyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bloud doth require bloud and tyranny will have cruelty. <hi>Antiochus</hi> famed in tyranny brought in ſubjection Egypt, and India with other countries</p>

                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> excelled all men in tyranny, as both Rome and Italy can well teſtifie. To ſpeak of King <hi>Philip</hi> and his ſon <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, their tyranny, their conqueſt, and bloudy wars, it were ſuperfluous, as Theſſalia Thebes Lariſſa, the Olinthians, Phoceans, Lacedemonians, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Perſians, Indians, and all Aſia are witneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:

                  <hi>Pyrrhus, Antigonus, Pompey</hi> the great, with infinite more bloudy Generals, did more rejoyce with tyranny to offend others, then with juſtice to defend their own. For the triumphs of cruel Captains are to joy in tyranny, the wiſh and deſire of the ungodly tyrant is to deſtroy all, he is thirſty alwaies of bloud, hungry continually of murther and ſlaughter. What wiſhed <hi>Caligula</hi> the Emperour to his own City of Rome? onely one neck, that with one ſtroke he might ſtrike it off.</p>
               <p>The difference betwéen a gentle and a goodly Prince, and a cruell tyrant, is, and hath béen alwaies ſéen. King <hi>Codrus</hi> of Athens, how far excelled he cruell <hi>Caligula?</hi> when by an Oracle it was told to the Athenians, that they ſhould never have victory during the life of <hi>Codrus</hi> their King the King underſtanding of it, he cloathed himſelf like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldier, nay rather as the hiſtory ſaith, like a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and went into the midſt of his enemies to be ſlain to ſave Athens. How much did noble <hi>Curtius,</hi> and famous <hi>Decius</hi> ſurmounted that cruell <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> and that wicked imp <hi>C. Marius;</hi> they inſtructed by the like Oracle, were ready in their arms to mount on horſeback to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alive, to an open gulf to ſave Rome: the other with ſword and fire were no leſſe willing to deſtroy Rome, and to ſpoil their native ſoil and country of Italy. Again <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibulus</hi> was not ſo beneficial to Athens, but <hi>Catelin</hi> was as hurtfull unto Rome.</p>
               <p>Divers Princes and Noble men have béen no leſſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious how to kéep and defend their countries, then they were loath and unwilling to treſpaſſe againſt their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Happy are thoſe places, and moſt happy are they that injoy ſuch Princes. How famous was Thebes while <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paminondas</hi> lived? how renowned was Sparta, while yet <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ruled? how happy was Rome when <hi>Fabius Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi> bare ſway? how flouriſhed Athens when <hi>Pericles</hi> with his magnanimity, when <hi>Themiſiocles</hi> with his worthineſſe, when <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> with his wiſedome defended their ſtate?

               <p>Such is the furious rage of tyranny, that without mercy and reſpect of perſon, he féedeth his fury.

well compared to the Crocodiles of Nilus, or to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens of the ſeas, the one weeping and mourning, the other ſinging and laughing, the one with lamentation, the other with mirth doth ſtudy how to annoy the poor Mariner. The flattering Paraſite, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaith, denieth with the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and affirmeth with the affirmative; wéepeth with him that is ſad, and laugheth with him that is merry: As ſometime <hi>Cliſophus,</hi> who when his maſter <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, and further to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, did halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had the gout, he would halt likewiſe; when the King would be merry at his drink, <hi>Cliſophus</hi> would not be ſad: In fine, whatſoever <hi>Philip</hi> took in hand, the ſame <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophus</hi> did imitate. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Philoſopher, could better pleaſe King <hi>Dionyſius</hi> with adulation, the <hi>Dion</hi> the Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſan could pleaſure him with truth. <hi>Cleo</hi> could better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the deſire and luſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> with forged flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> his counſellour could ſatisfie him with Philoſophy.

Not <hi>Pompey</hi> his ſon in Law, nor yet his onely daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> nor all the Senatours of Rome.</p>
               <p>Flatterers are dangerous to the moſt part, hurtfull to all, profitable to none, and yet of Princes moſt accepted: Vnder the ſhape of humanity, they ſway and rule in Court like furious Centaurs, deformed Scyllaes, huge Cyclops, grim Gorgons, fretting Furies, and monſtrous Harpies; yea, with a thouſand more deformities. For who is more made of then he that ought leaſt to be eſteemed? who is truſted more then he that deceiveth ſooneſt? who is heard more at all times then he that ought leaſt to come in ſight at any time? who hath more of all men then he that deſerveth leaſt of all men? In fine, who is more beloved any where then he that ought moſt to be hated every where? The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the Medes and Perſians, for that they knéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and made him the ſon of <hi>Jupiter</hi> were more eſtéemed for their flattery therein, then the Nobles of Macedonia for their truth and plain dealing.</p>

                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:107135:147"/>What is it but flattery bringeth it to paſſe? That which that famous and renowned Prince <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> with all the force and power of Gréece, could not with ten years ſiege ſubdue; one ſubtil <hi>Sinon,</hi> a ſimple and a ſilly Greek, allured the mind of King <hi>Priam</hi> unto and deceived with flattery his Nobles, and entiſed the Citizens through adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their utter deſtruction, and laſt confuſion. That ancient and renowned City of Babilon, which King <hi>Darius</hi> with all the power of Perſia was never able to vanquiſh, one <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> a Citizen born in Babilon, through forged faith and filed flattery, I ſay, betrayed it unto King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſpeak of the ancient Lacedemonians, the moſt famous and worthieſt people in the whole world for their wars; whom neither Medes Perſians, Macedonians, nor all Greece could vanquiſh; <hi>Phrinicus</hi> with his flattery deceived them. The people of Sambs were deceived by falſe <hi>Apollonius. Menelaus</hi> was beguiled with the flattery of <hi>Paris. Dion</hi> of Syracuſa was ſlain by his flattering friend <hi>Galicrates.</hi> O ſucking ſerpent of malice, whoſe fruit is death! If King <hi>Antigonus</hi> had known the flattery of his feigned friend <hi>Apollophanes,</hi> he had not been deceived as he was. If King <hi>Aſtyages</hi> had throughly known <hi>Harpagus</hi> his ſervant he had not been ſlain by King <hi>Cyrus.</hi> If that noble and famous Roman <hi>Craſſus</hi> had weighed the flattery of <hi>Carenus</hi> he had not been ſo ſhamefully murthered among the Parthians.</p>
               <p>What flattery was between <hi>Jaſon</hi> and <hi>Medea?</hi> what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit followed? What adulation was betwixt <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Ariadne?</hi> what falſhood enſued? The one helping <hi>Jaſon</hi> to the Golden Fleece, the other delivering <hi>Theſeus</hi> out of the dreadfull Labyrinth from the monſter <hi>Minotantus,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by flattery. But paſſe we forward in the Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and affairs of Princes. Who murthered <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that worthy Emperour, in the Senate houſe of Rome? <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> thoſe flatterers that <hi>Caeſar</hi> loved moſt. Who poyſoned that mighty Conqueror <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the midſt of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107135:148"/>
his triumphs at Babylon? thoſe that flattered him moſt, his own Cup-taſter, <hi>lola,</hi> and his kinſman <hi>Antipater.</hi> Who betrayed that famous Roman <hi>Cicero</hi> to his meer enemy <hi>Marcus Antonius?</hi> even he whom <hi>Cicero</hi> before defended and ſaved from death, <hi>Popilius.</hi> Finally, who betrayed Chriſt, both God and Man, to the Scribes and Phariſees? his purſe-bearer, that flattering <hi>Judas</hi> with fair ſpéech, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Avi Rabbi,</hi> embracing and kiſſing him as flatterers uſe to do.</p>
               <p>Where is there greater tyranny ſhewed then where flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is moſt uſed? Where is there greater deceit practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then where courteſie is moſt tendered? Where is more falſhood, then where truſt is moſt repoſed? The firſt thing that deceived man was flattery, which the Devil tho ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent put in ure to deceive <hi>Eve;</hi> flattering her, ſaying, If thou eat of this fruit thou ſhalt know good and evil, and you ſhall be as Gods on earth. As the Devil is the onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all lies, ſo is he the onely Father of flattery, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting always the beſt and not the worſt; accompanying the higheſt, and not the loweſt, frequenting the Court more then the Countrey, and approaching near to Princes, and not to Beggars.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt was aſſaulted with the flattery of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, promiſing him all the world if he would knéel and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: I would to God that all Princes would ſpeak to flatterers as Chriſt ſpake to the Devil: Avoid Satan: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way flatterer. Or elſe I wiſh that wiſe men, who are ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all by flattery allured, would imitate the example of a noble man of Thebes, named <hi>Itmenius,</hi> who being ſent Embaſſadour from Thebes to Perſia, underſtanding the manners &amp; faſhions of the proud Perſians, and that nothing could be gotten without flattery, nor heard without knéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did let fall his ring on the ground, whereby he might ſtoop before the King, not to the King, but to take up his ring. Or elſe I would wiſh all men to anſwer flatterers, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> anſwered <hi>Ariſtippus;</hi> who ſpeaking to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that if <hi>Diogenes</hi> could be content to flatter <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the

               <p>It is read in <hi>Caelius,</hi> that the maid-ſervants of Cyprus were ſo giuen to flattery, that they knéeled down to bow and bend their ſhoulders, as a footſtool to their Ladies to mount into their Chariots: ſurely the men of Perſia and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Cyprus engendred ſuch numbers of flattering Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, that glorious maſters now never want flattering ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The ſchollers of Gnato frequent always Thraſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal places. Have we not many now a days, that will ſpeak to their friends as <hi>Niceſias</hi> was wont to ſay to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great being wounded, and his bloud ſpinning out? O what noble bloud is this! This bloud comes from ſome God and not from man. The wiſe man ſaith that five things ought of all men to be miſtruſted; a ſtrange dog, an unknown horſe, a hollow bank, a talkative woman, and a flattering ſervant. Fair words makes fools glad; yea flattering ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches overcommeth wiſe men. <hi>Demetrius</hi> having obtained vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the wars at Salamina, was ſo joyfull of his fortune, that he did ſend <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> a very ſublil and a cunning flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, to certifie his father King <hi>Antigonus</hi> of his proſperous ſucceſſe, giving in charge unto him to ſhew the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orderly the triumph and victory in the largeſt manner. <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> no leſſe joyfull of the meſſage, then skilfull in flattery, leaving his Navy, and his company in Cyprus, went on land toward King <hi>Antigonus;</hi> who having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> was come from his ſon <hi>Demetrius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of the newes, and to heare of the Wars and ſucceſſe of his ſon, ſent divers to méet him on the way, to know the truth and effect of his comming: He ſaluted all men as one very ſad, and ſo ſad, that all men judged that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Demetrius</hi> was ſlain, or elſe had loſt the field. The King being certified that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> was very ſad, and that there was no likelihood of good news, came haſtily to meet him; which when <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> ſaw, he cryed out with a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107135:149"/>
loud voice a far off ſaying: Moſt happy art thou King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> beloved of the Gods, ſaluted by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and this day feared of all the world. Thy ſon is Conquerour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Conquerours and King over Kings a triumphant vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the wars at Salamina: thus artificially did <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> uſe his flattery before King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that the King had as great a delight to hear <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> flattering phraſe, as he had joy and gladneſſe in the proſperity of his ſon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</hi> Thus he did win the heart, and dived into the ſoul of King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that his reward was as much by his flattery, as his thanks was for his news. <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was delighted ſo much in the flattering ſpéech of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, at what time he was inforced to forſake Rome by means of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> that the Citizens of Athens went to méet him out of the City, having an Oration in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his wiſedom, ſaying: that he was well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to have <hi>Minerva</hi> in marriage. He joied ſo much in this their adulation that they won this Roman by flattery to do more honour unto Athens, then nature could crave at his hands to love Rome.

                     </gap>chus</hi> with ſugred words and fair ſentences aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged his ſorrow. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> when he might not obtain his purpoſe at <hi>Dioniſius</hi> hand with flattery and fair words, he would knéel down, and imbrace and kiſſe his féet, and being accuſed of his friends, that he being a Philoſopher, he was a flatterer, he anſwered them in this ſort: <hi>Ariſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> is not in fault to ſpeak unto any man where his ear is, <hi>Dioniſius</hi> rather is to be blamed to hear at his féet, or to have his ears at his héels. <hi>Diogenes</hi> therefore being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what beaſt was moſt hurtfull to man: of wild beaſts a tyrant, of tame beaſts a flatterer. What ſubject is he that delighteth not in flattery? what Prince is he that is not pleaſed with adulation? What God is he, ſaith the Poet, that loveth not his commendation and praiſe? <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> was glad to hear the adulation of <hi>Cecropes, Bacchus</hi>

was joyfull to hear the flattery of <hi>Silenus:</hi> even <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf the King of Gods was delighted in <hi>Vulcan.</hi> The remedy therefore to avoid this Gorgon, to expell this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to exile this murtherer is as <hi>Cato</hi> the wiſe man ſaith, to uſe truth, for he that uſeth to hear good talk alwaies, will never himſelf ſpeak evill at any time. The nature of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was ſo known, and was ſo hated by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that he lothed the knéeling of his houſhold ſervants. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour likewiſe would in no wiſe ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his own men to call him Lord. Flattery was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo abhorred in Athens, that when <hi>Timagoras</hi> was ſent as an Embaſſadour to <hi>Darius</hi> K. of Perſia, for that he flattered the King in talk, at his return, he was beheaded. Even ſo <hi>Evagoras</hi> becauſe he called <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> was put to death.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians feared flattery ſo much, that they baniſhed <hi>Archilogus</hi> onely for his eloquence in a book which he compoſed. Flattery was ſo odious in Rome, that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor gave commandement to expell certain fine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours of Athens, out of Rome, leſt by their fair ſpéech and flattery they might annoy the ſtate of Rome. What is it but flattery can compaſſe? what may not ſugred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours move? what could not <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> do in Athens? what might not <hi>Cicero</hi> perſwade in Rome? King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was wont to ſay, that he won more Cities, Towns, and Countries, through the flattering perſwaſions of <hi>Cineas,</hi> then he ever ſubdued with the ſtrength and force of all the Kingdome of Epire.

                  </hi> the great, theſe Philoſophers, becauſe they would not féed the corrupt natures and inſolent minds of theſe proud Princes with adulation and flattery, they were put to death: <hi>Seneca</hi> by <hi>Nero</hi> for his pain and travel taken with the Emperour in reading him Philoſophy <hi>Caliſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe he reproved the cuſtomes of the Medes and Perſians who uſed ſuch flattery, that <hi>Alexander</hi> commanded all men to call him the ſon of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Even ſo <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> the one the ſoveraign Oratour and the Phenix of Rome, the other the ſugred anchor and the patron of Athens, and protector of all Gréece; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſundry times ſaved the two famous Cities Rome and Athens, the one from the pernicious and privy conſpiracy of that wicked <hi>Catelin</hi> and his adherents the other from the proud attempts and the long wars of <hi>Philip</hi> King of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet were they both baniſhed and exiled their own countries <hi>Cicero</hi> for <hi>Clodius</hi> ſake, which the Romans took ſo heavily, that twenty thouſand did wear mourning appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with no leſſe heavineſſe in Rome, then tears were ſhed for <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in Athens.

Too many examples might be brought from Gréek and Latine hiſtories for the proof hereof. The chiefeſt bulwark of a Common-wealth ſaith <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> is aſſured faith without flattery, and good will tried in the Commons, and plainneſſe without deceit, boldneſſe and truſt in the Nobility. Flattery is the onely ſnare that wiſe men are deceived withall, and this the pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſées knew well, who when they would take our Saviour Chriſt tardy in his talk, they began to flatter him with fair words, ſaying: Maſter we know that thou art juſt and true, and that thou cameſt from God.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is neither beaſt on the earth, nor fowl in the ayr, nor fiſh in the ſea, that ſéeks his own decay, but man onely; as by experience we ſée all things to have a care of their own lives. The Lion when he féeleth himſelf ſick he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſeth till he féedeth upon an Ape, whereby he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his former health. The Goats of Créet féeding on high upon the mountains, when any of them is ſhot through with an arrow, as the people of that Countrey are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent archers, they ſeek out an herb called Dictamum, and aſſoon as they eat any part of it, the arrow falleth down, and the wound waxeth whole incontinently, There are certain kinds of Frogs in Egypt, about the floud of Nilus, that have this perceiverance, that when by chance they happen to come where a fiſh called Varus is, which is great a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer and ſpoiler of Frogs, they uſe to bear in their mouths overthwart, a long reed, which groweth about the banks of Nile; and as this fiſh doth gape thinking to feed upon the Frog, the reed is ſo long that by no means he can ſwallow the Frog; and ſo they ſave their lives. If the Goats of Creet, if the Frogs of Egypt have this underſtanding to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void their enemies; how much more ought man to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect of his life, who hath millions of enemies neither ſeen nor known.</p>
               <p>We read in the firſt book of <hi>Aelian,</hi> that the rude ſwine, if at any time by chance they eat of that herb called Hioſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus, which ſo contracteth &amp; draweth their veins together that they can hardly ſtir, they will ſtrive for remedy to go under the water, where they feed upon young Crabs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover health. In the ſame book you may read of a ſea Snail, which from the water doth come to land to breed, and after ſhe hath egged, ſhe diggeth the earth, and hideth her egs, and returneth to the ſea again, and there continueth fourty days;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107135:151"/>
and after fourty days, ſhe commeth to the ſelf ſame place where ſhe hid her egs, and perceiving that they are ready to come out of the ſhell, ſhe openeth the ſhell, and taketh her young ones with her into the ſea. And thus have they a care not onely of their own ſtates and lives but alſo of others; and by ſome ſhew of ſence they help that which is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and hurtfull.</p>
               <p>The little Mice have this kind of fore-knowledge, that when any houſe waxeth old and ruinous, they forſake their old dwelling and creeping holes, and flee and ſeek refuge in ſome other place. The little Ants have ſuch fore-ſight, that when penury and want of relief draweth near, they wax painfull and laborious, to gather victuals as may ſerve them during the time of famine. If theſe ſmall creeping worms and ſimple beaſts provide for themſelves; what ſhall we ſay of man, the King and ruler over all beaſts, who hath not onely a body to provide for, but alſo a ſoul to ſave? More happy are theſe worms and beaſts in their kind, then a number of Princes are; for that they by nature onely are taught to avoid their foes, we neither by nature neither by God the cauſe of all goodneſſe can love our friends. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very well it is ſaid of the wiſe man, that either not to be born, or elſe being born ſtraight to die, is the happieſt ſtate that can chance to man; For living in this vale of miſery, we ſee the Pilgrimage and travel of life to be ſuch, that better far it were to be a poor quiet man, then a proud ambitious Prince.</p>
               <p>And ſince death is the laſt line of life, as well appointed for Princes as for poor men, who in reading of the lives of Emperors, Kings and Princes, and the Nobles of the world, ſeeth not their unhappy ſtates, which come into the world naked, and depart from the ſame naked yet like proud Pilgrims are buſie one to deſtroy another: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with countreys and Kingdomes, they go from place to place like Pilgrims, to be more acquainted with miſery, and to ſeek death. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great conquerour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:107135:152"/>
in a deſire to deſtroy all the world, he was in the City of Babylon prevented by <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Iola</hi> with poyſon, and there he died. <hi>Philopomenes,</hi> a great Emperor ſometime in Gréece, being taken priſoner in the wars of Meſſena, was ſo cruelly handled, that he beſought <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> who then was Prince of that countrey, and conquerour over him, one dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught of poyſon to end his life: Thus he that could not be content to be Emperor and ruler of Gréece, was moved to ſeek death in a ſtrange Countrey amongſt his foes. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> King of Apulia endeavouring to ſubdue the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and ſéeking to be King over the Florentines loſt the Kingdome of Apulia, and by them was at length poyſoned, and ſo bereft both of Kingdome and life.</p>
               <p>With this unhappy kind of death many Princes have been prevented; and no leſſe threatned are theſe Princes by their own houſhold friends, then by forraign foes: No leſſe do their children, their wives, brethren and kinſmen ſtudy to deſtroy them. Thus <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> an Emperor of Rome, was poyſoned by his own wife <hi>Agrippina. Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> King of Syria was poyſoned by his Quéen <hi>Laodice,</hi> ſo that he was in love with <hi>Berenices,</hi> King <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s ſiſterr <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor, the ſon of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> being but one year a ruler in the Empire, was poyſoned by his mother in Law named <hi>Martina.</hi> The very cauſe of the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radus</hi> death who was <hi>Fredericks</hi> ſon was onely the Empire and rule of Rome; for <hi>Manfredus</hi> his ſucceſſour hired the Phyſitians to poyſon him, that he might have the onely ſway. O unhappy ſtate of Princes, whoſe lives are deſired both of friends and foes.</p>
               <p>No leſſe danger it is to be in favour with Princes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, then perillous to be Princes. We read of a Quéen named <hi>Roſimunda,</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Cunimund</hi> of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pida, who after ſhe had poyſoned <hi>Albonius</hi> King of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobards, her firſt husband did marry a Prince of Ravenna named <hi>Helinges,</hi> whom likwiſe ſhe thought to poiſon; but being warned in the middeſt of his draught, he cauſed his wife to drink the reſt, which drink was the cauſe of both

their deaths. How many noble Princes in the middeſt of their pilgrimages have died that death? as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour of Rome, <hi>Lotarius</hi> King of France, <hi>Charls</hi> the eight of that name, with divers others, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> prince of Carthage, <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> King of Iudea, and <hi>Lucullus</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of Rome.</p>
               <p>Princes and noble men do ſometime poiſon themſelves, leſt they ſhould be inforced to ſerve their foes, as <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> being baniſhed from his country of Athens, being in ſervice under <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of Perſia, poiſoned himſelf with the bloud of a Bull, in preſence of all the Perſians, leſt he ſhould be compelled to fight in wars againſt Gréece his country. Even ſo <hi>Aratus</hi> prince of Sicionia, perceiving <hi>Philip</hi> the younger would baniſh and exile him out of his country, was inforced with poiſon to drink his own death out of his own hand Even after this ſort, after long admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Commonwealth, did noble <hi>Socrates,</hi> learned <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> worthy <hi>Seneca,</hi> and famous <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> poiſon themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus their pilgrimages were ended, and their lives fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, their honour and dignity, their fame and renown did purchaſe them death. Happy then are thoſe whom the world knows not, who deſire not to be acquainted with the world, but quiet and contented do finiſh the courſe of their pilgrimages. Had not <hi>Jugurthus</hi> thirſted for the Kingdom of Numidia, he had not ſlain his two brethren <hi>Adherbal</hi> and <hi>Hempſal,</hi> which were partakers of the Crown, for the which vengeance fell upon him, being ſubdued by <hi>Marius,</hi> and dying afterwards in priſon Had not King <hi>Siphax</hi> thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the Empire of Rome, he had never béen taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and priſoner by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> where he at length out of his Kingdome died in priſon. <hi>Henry</hi> the third was of his own ſon named <hi>Henry</hi> put again in priſon, where he died. <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> for all his buſineſſe and great doings, was vanquiſhed by the Conſull <hi>Aquilius,</hi> and put in priſon where likewiſe he died.</p>

countries. Strange kinds of deaths, happen upon Princes more then on any other men, as orderly I ſhall prove by their pilgrimages and lives. Some by fire, as the Tyrant <hi>Phalaris</hi> of Agrigentum, who was burned with all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his wife in the Braſen Bull which <hi>Perillus</hi> made for others, &amp; was firſt of all put into it himſelf. By fire was the Emperour <hi>Valentine</hi> burned by the Goths, by fire was that famous Greek <hi>Alcibiades</hi> deſtroied in Phrygia, and burned in bed with his miſtreſſe <hi>Timandra,</hi> after he had ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Athens and all Greece a long while, <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> that great King, and laſt prince of Aſſyria, fearing to fall into the hands of <hi>Arbactus,</hi> and deteſting to die by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies made a ſolemn fire, when after his lewd life, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in luſt, and following his deſires, he burned himſelf: it was the end of the renowned <hi>Hercules,</hi> who conquered Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſubdued Serpents Lions, Dragons and wild beaſts; at the laſt he put on the ſhirt of <hi>Neſtus</hi> the Centaur which burned him alive.

               <p>So deſirous were men alwaies to become princes, ſo ambitious of honour, ſo greedy of wealth, that having the name of a King, they thought to avoid and eſcape that, which alwaies waits on the heels of Princes, I mean death. Were not princes hanged by their own ſubjects, which is the vileſt and moſt ignominious death that can be? <hi>Achaeas</hi> King of Lidia, for that he troubled his ſubjects with new taxes and ſubſedies, was hanged by his own ſubjects at the river of <hi>Pactolus. Bomilchar</hi> a Prince of Libia, being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the Carthaginians, that he had conſpired with <hi>Agathocles,</hi> unto the annoiance of the ſubjects, was hanged in the City of Carthage, in the middeſt of the Market. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licrates</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:107135:153"/>
who was ſuppoſed to be the happieſt Prince that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reigned in Samos, and never ſuſtained any loſſe by fortune, was at laſt by <hi>Orontes</hi> the Perſian, King <hi>Darius</hi> General hanged in ſight of Samos. <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth affirm, that <hi>Leonides</hi> that famous King of Sparta, who long ruled the Lacedemonians with great fame and renown, was by <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of Perſia, after his head was ſmitten off, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded notwithſtanding to be hanged. <hi>Trogus</hi> doth write of <hi>Hanno</hi> a prince of Carthage, which flouriſhed in the time of King <hi>Philip,</hi> father to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who for his proſperous ſucceſſe that he had in all his attempts, waxed to be ſuch a tyrant, that his own people firſt bound him with cords, whipt him with rods, pluckt out his eys, brake his legs, cut off his hands, and at laſt to recompence his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they hanged him up in Carthage. Theſe were no mean men, that thus were hanged in their own country, and by their own people. Thus Princes in the middeſt of their lives have béen arreſted by death, and by divers kinds of death.</p>
               <p>Some as you have heard by poiſon, ſome by fire, ſome by hanging have ended their pilgrimages, ſome again have been devoured by their own horſes, as <hi>Diomedes</hi> King of Thracia became food himſelf to thoſe beaſts, which before he fed with mens bodies. The King of Eubea for his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in Boetia, was given by <hi>Hercules</hi> to be eaten by his own horſes. <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour, at what time he had appointed that his daughter <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even ſo were <hi>Herachtus</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> both Philoſophers, by dogs likewiſe killed. I may not forget ſo great a prince as <hi>Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Emperour of Macedon, who in hunting amongſt his Lords and Nobles, yea, amongſt thouſands of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he onely meeting a Hart in the chaſe, was hurt by him in the leg whereof he died.

               <p>The deſire that men bear unto honour and dignity, is commonly accompanied with death; as <hi>Spurius Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Spurius Melius</hi> for their greedineſſe of the Empire of Rome, were both worthily beheaded. God hath ſhewed juſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon Princes for their iniquity, with plagues and peſtilences, which ſpoiled the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the Empreſſe <hi>Zoae,</hi> his wife: And by this were <hi>Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Alphonſus,</hi> and <hi>Domitius</hi> juſtly and worthily puniſhed. God hath wonderfully puniſhed the pride of Princes, even with ſhamefull and horrible deaths, inſomuch that Lice and vermine have conſumed their bodies alive; As <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Arnulphus, Honorificus</hi> King of the Vandales, and <hi>Herode</hi> King of the Iews, were eaten up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live with vermine and Lice. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſay, that proud <hi>Sylla,</hi> which ſore plagued Rome and Italy, had all his fleſh converted into Lice, and ſo died. <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe report of one <hi>Pheretrina</hi> a Quéen of the Barceans, who died of this filthy and horrible death. God hath taken them away in the midſt of their pleaſure, even eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Septimus</hi> and <hi>Valentianus,</hi> two famous Emperours, who died both of a ſurfeit, for want of digeſtion, <hi>Archeſilaus</hi> died preſently with one draught of wine.</p>
               <p>What is the life of Princes, but an uncertain Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage? Nay, women are famous for their pilgrimage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: As the Queen of Sheba came from Ethiopia to hear and to learn <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wisdome. <hi>Cornelia</hi> from Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a noble woman, went to Paleſtina to hear Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> teach Chriſtians.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He laſt line of all things is death, the diſcharge of all covenants, the end of all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the onely wiſh of the good, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrour of the wicked. And for that the life of man is divers, ſo is death variable after ſundry manners and faſhions, as by experience is ſéen and known in all Countreys. Nothing is ſurer then death; yet nothing is more uncertain then death. For <hi>Pindarus</hi> that wiſe King of the Liricans, being demanded of certain Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otians, what might beſt happen to man in this world? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that (ſaid he) which chanced to <hi>Trophonius</hi> and <hi>Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> meaning Death: For theſe men after they had builded a new Temple to <hi>Apollo,</hi> demanded of <hi>Apollo</hi> the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that he could give them: they thinking to enjoy ſome dignity or worldly ſubſtance, were ſeven days after reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death.</p>
               <p>The like we read in the firſt Book of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> where the mother of <hi>Biton</hi> and <hi>Cleobes,</hi> two young men of Argos, knéeling before the Image of <hi>Juno,</hi> beſought the Goddeſſe to beſtow ſome excellent good thing upon her two ſons, for their pain and travel that they ſhewed toward her, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Chariot ten miles in ſtead of horſes: The Goddeſſe willing to grant them the beſt thing that could be given to man, the next night, quietly in bed as they ſlept, they both died. Wherefore very well did <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> anſwer a certain man who asked how <hi>Socrates</hi> died: Even in that order, ſaid he, that I wiſh my ſelf to die. Giving to underſtand, that any death is better then life.</p>
               <p>That noble Philoſopher <hi>Plato,</hi> a little before he died, as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> doth write, did thank nature for three cauſes; the firſt, that he was born a man, and not a beaſt; the ſecond, that he was born in Gréece, and not in Barbary; the third, that he was born in <hi>Socrates</hi> time, who taught him to die
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:107135:156"/>
well. <hi>Hermes</hi> that great Philoſopher of Egypt, even dying, ſo embraced death, that he called upon that that divine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which ruled all the heavens, to have mercy upon him, being right glad that he had paſſed this toyling life. Such is the uncertainty of death, that ſome in the half of their days, and in the midſt of their fame and glory, die. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great died in Babilon, <hi>Pompey</hi> died in Egypt, and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> being a young man of great towardneſſe, and by adoption heir unto the Empire of Rome, died.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange to ſée the varieties of death and in how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſundry faſhions it hath happened unto Great men always. Some being merry in their banquets, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſlain; ſo <hi>Clitus</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, being his chief friend. <hi>Amnon</hi> being bidden to a banquet by <hi>Abſalom,</hi> was ſlain by him. Yea, all the Embaſſadors of Perſia were commanded to be ſlain, even drinking at the table, by <hi>Amintas</hi> King of Macedonia. Some end their lives wantonning with women, and playing in chambers; as that renowned <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> being taken in wantonneſſe with <hi>Timandra,</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Liſander.</hi> Even ſo <hi>Phaon</hi> and <hi>Speuſippus</hi> the Philoſopher died likewiſe. Some bathing and refreſhing themſelves, have periſhed by their own wives: ſo <hi>Agamemnon</hi> that famous Gréek was killed by his wife <hi>Clitemneſtra;</hi> and <hi>Argirus</hi> Emperor of Rome by his wife <hi>Zoe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers in priſon have died as captives; ſo <hi>Ariſtobulus, Eumenes, Ariſtonicus, Marius, Cleomenes, Jugurth, Siphax,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned Princes. Divers have béen ſlain in the draught, as that beaſt <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> whom Rome ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he fled to a draught, and there was ſlain, and after was drawn through the ſtreets and thrown into the river of Tyber. <hi>Cneius Carbo</hi> a man of great dignity and power in Rome, was commanded that he ſhould be ſlain, as he was ſitting on his ſtool of eaſe, by <hi>Pompey,</hi> in the third time of his Conſulſhip in Rome. Thus ſhamefully have ſome died, and thus famouſly others died. <hi>Patroclus</hi> knew not that he ſhould be ſlain by <hi>Hector, Hector</hi> never thought he ſhould
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:107135:157"/>
be killed by <hi>Achilles. Achilles</hi> never doubted his death by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Paris</hi> never judged that he ſhould be vanquiſhed by <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus.</hi> Neither did <hi>Pirrhus</hi> know that he ſhould be overcome by <hi>Oreſtes:</hi> ſo that no man knoweth his end, where, how, and when he ſhall die, and yet all men are certain and ſure, that they have an end, that they muſt néeds die. And yet the fear of death hath overcome the ſtouteſt ſouldiers. We read that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> of Carthage, a noble and a famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>verthrown by <hi>Scipio,</hi> for fear of death knéeled before <hi>Scipio,</hi> embracing his féet, and was ſo fearfull that his own wife was aſhamed of his doings; Yet had this famous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rather be a laughing ſtock to the Romans a bond man to <hi>Scipio,</hi> running a foot like a lacky after his triumph, then to die manfully in the behalf of his countrey, which vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly for a time he defended. <hi>Perpenna</hi> likewiſe a famous Roman, being taken in Spain, by the ſouldiers of <hi>Pompey</hi> in a place full of Groves, fearing leſt at that inſtant he ſhould be ſlain by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſouldiers, he made them believe that he had divers things to ſpeak to <hi>Pompey,</hi> of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns that the enemies had in hand againſt him: rather had <hi>Perpenna</hi> betray his friends and his fellows, yea, and all his country to his enemy, then ſuffer a ſudden death. A greater fear of death we read in that book of <hi>Fulgoſius,</hi> of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who after he had vanquiſhed and ſlain divers nobles, and ſhewed great wrongs unto the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> and to <hi>Sabinus,</hi> brother to <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour, being in fear of his life by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and being taken by the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, hee beſought them, rather then die preſently, that hee might be kept ſafe in priſon, untill he might ſée and ſpeak with <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour; ſuch was his fear, that he did hide himſelf in a cheſt to prolong his wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched life.</p>
               <p>So fearful was <hi>Caligula</hi> of death that he would never go abroad at any Lightning or Thunder, but had his head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with all ſuch things as might reſiſt the violence of Lightning, <hi>Miſa</hi> King of the Moabites, and <hi>Joram</hi> King of Iewry, being beſieged by the enemies, and in danger of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107135:157"/>
death, they practiſed deviſes and invenſions to ſave their lives, and ſacrificed their children, to mitigate the rage of the Gods. The love that divers had unto life, and the fear they had of death were to be noted worthily conſidering how much men are vexed with the fear of death. <hi>Antemon</hi> was ſo deſirous to live and ſo fearfull to die, that he hardly would travel out of his houſe any where; and if he were compelled to go abroad, he would have two of his ſervants to bear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head a great braſen Target, to defend him from any thing which might happen to do him hurt. <hi>Theagenes</hi> in like ſort would not go out of his houſe, without he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Image of <hi>Hecate,</hi> to know what ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him that day, and to underſtand whether he might eſcape death or no. <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour would never truſt any Barber to ſhave his beard leſt his throat ſhould be cut. <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> King of Numidia would rather commit his ſtate and life unto dogs, then unto men, who was as his guard to kéep and defend him from death. I might here ſpeak of <hi>Bion,</hi> of <hi>Domitianus,</hi> of <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> of <hi>Piſander,</hi> and of a thouſand more, who ſo feared death that their chief care and ſtudy was how they might avoid the ſame. The fear of death cauſeth the ſon to forſake the father, the mother to renounce the daughter, one brother to deny another, and one friend to forſake another, Inſomuch that Chriſt himſelf was forſaken of his diſciples for fear of death. <hi>Peter</hi> denied him and all the reſt fled from him and all for fear of death Behold therefore how fearfull ſome are and how joyfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are. Some deſperately have died being weary of life. As <hi>Sabinus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uba, Cleomenes,</hi> ſome have hanged, ſome have burned, and ſome drowned themſelves, and thus with one deſperate end or other periſhed. But ſince every man muſt die, it were reaſon that every man ſhould prepare to die for to die well is nothing elſe but to live again. Wherefore certain philoſophers of India called the <hi>Gymnoſophiſlae</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great commanded to anſwer to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hard queſtions, which if they could abſolve they ſhould live, otherwiſe they ſhould die. The firſt queſtion
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:107135:158"/>
propounded to know whether there were more living or dead; to the which the firſt philoſopher ſaid, that the living are more in number becauſe the dead have no being, no place, nor number. The ſecond queſtion was whether the land produced more creatures, or the ſea; to this anſwered the ſecond philoſopher and ſaid, the land doth ingender more for that the ſea is but a portion of the land. The third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was to know, what beaſt was moſt ſubtil; that beaſt anſwered the third philoſopher, whoſe ſubtilty man cannot diſcern. Fourthly it was demanded why they being philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were ſo induced to perſwade the Sabians to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe ſaid the philoſophers it is better to die manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then to live miſerably. The fifth queſtion was, whether the day was made before the night, or the night before the day; to the which it was anſwered the day. The ſixt was to underſtand how <hi>Alexander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Great himſelf might get y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good wil of the people; in ſhewing ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſixth philoſopher thy ſelf not terrible to the people. The ſeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th queſtion was whether life or death were ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger; to which it was a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered, life. The eight was to know how long a man ſhould live; till ſaid the eight philoſopher, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinks death better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life. The laſt queſtion propoſed by <hi>Alexander</hi> was, how might a mortal man be accounted in the number of the Gods. In doing greater things ſaid all the Philoſophers then man is able to do. For they knew this proud Prince would be a God, and that he would learn of the ſage Philoſophers how he might eſchew mortality, he was anſwered roundly becauſe he ſhould know himſelf to be a man, and being a man, he ſhould make himſelf ready to die, for death is the reward of ſin, and death is the beginning again of life unto the good. As <hi>Aulus Poſthumius,</hi> in an Oration which he made unto his ſouldiers, ſaid, it is given to both good and bad to die, but to die g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even ſo <hi>Phiſarchus</hi> ſometime in his great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph crying out, O happy hours and joyful days, was taken with ſuch an extaſie of joy, that he brake his veins at that very inſtant with the exceſſe of gladneſſe,</p>
